Energy-aware virtual machine management optimization in clouds,Z. Xiaoqing,"School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China",2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC),,2017,,,2434,2438,"Cloud computing provides a kind of dynamic and scalable service on demand. However, clouds consume huge amounts of electrical energy. Meanwhile, delivering the negotiated QoS defined as Service Level Agreement (SLA) to users is necessary. A virtual machine placement strategy based on the equilibrium between energy and SLA is proposed. Aiming at dynamical changes of application workloads, an adaptive placement strategy RLWR based on robust local weight regression is presented, which decides the overload time of hosts dynamically according to the historical resource occupation of application workload. Then, two virtual machine migration selection algorithms, MPM and MNM are presented. The migrated virtual machines are deployed using bin-packing algorithm PBFDH. Contrasting to static algorithms such as STH, MPA and DVFS, virtual machines are not only deployed on fewer hosts in our algorithm, which promotes energy efficiency, but the load prediction can bring high-reliable QoS delivery and avoid overmuch SLA violations. Experimental results show that our strategy has an obvious effect on decreasing SLA violation under ensuring energy efficiency.",,978-1-5090-6352-9978-1-5090-6353,10.1109/CompComm.2017.8322972,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8322972,cloud computing;virtual machine placement;energy efficient,Virtual machining;Energy consumption;Random access memory;Optimization;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Quality of service,cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;energy conservation;power aware computing;quality of service;virtual machines,electrical energy;negotiated QoS;Service Level Agreement;virtual machine placement strategy;adaptive placement strategy RLWR;robust local weight regression;historical resource occupation;bin-packing algorithm PBFDH;static algorithms;energy efficiency;high-reliable QoS delivery;energy-aware virtual machine management optimization;clouds;cloud computing;dynamic service;scalable service;SLA violations;virtual machine migration selection,,,,11,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It caters the users with least financial burden. Cloud uses virtualization for resource management through Virtual Machine (VM). An important aspect of cloud computing remains Quality of Service (QoS), often referred as Service Level Agreement (SLA). Several user applications simultaneously compete for resources in data centers. With limitations in available resources and compelling SLAs, VMs have to be migrated live during execution. Another concern in Clouds remains energy efficiency because of huge sized servers and communication requirements; most of the investment goes in power.

In NCDCs, tens of thousands of virtual machines (VMs) are assigned to physical servers to provide data-intensive services with a quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee, and consume a massive amount of energy in the process. Although many VM placement schemes have been proposed to solve this problem of energy consumption, most of these assume that all the physical servers are homogeneous. However, the physical server configurations of NCDCs often differ significantly, which leads to varying energy consumption characteristics. In this paper, we explore an alternative VM placement approach to minimize energy consumption during the provision of data-intensive services with a global QoS guarantee in NCDCs.

However the large amount of electrical energy consumed by cloud data centers creates one of the major hindrances in the advancement of cloud by increasing the operational costs. It also affects the environment by the emission of carbon dioxide. These challenges motivate the researchers to develop algorithms that can minimize consumption of energy in cloud data center. VM consolidation is one of such methods that saves energy by increasing total count of inactive servers. But its effect on the overall cloud performance is a bit negative. The average response time of the jobs increases since the workload is distributed on lesser number of active servers. So to maintain the energy-performance trade-off VM consolidation must be done in a restricted manner. The paper has proposed a novel approach of adding a constraint to the existing VM consolidation technique to avoid unnecessary VM migration.

Managing Overloaded Hosts for Dynamic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Cloud Data Centers under Quality of Service Constraints,A. Beloglazov; R. Buyya,"The University of Melbourne, Melbourne; THe University of Melbourne, Melbourne",IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,,2013,24,7,1366,1379,"Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) is an effective way to improve the utilization of resources and energy efficiency in cloud data centers. Determining when it is best to reallocate VMs from an overloaded host is an aspect of dynamic VM consolidation that directly influences the resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) delivered by the system. The influence on the QoS is explained by the fact that server overloads cause resource shortages and performance degradation of applications. Current solutions to the problem of host overload detection are generally heuristic based, or rely on statistical analysis of historical data. The limitations of these approaches are that they lead to suboptimal results and do not allow explicit specification of a QoS goal. We propose a novel approach that for any known stationary workload and a given state configuration optimally solves the problem of host overload detection by maximizing the mean intermigration time under the specified QoS goal based on a Markov chain model. We heuristically adapt the algorithm to handle unknown nonstationary workloads using the Multisize Sliding Window workload estimation technique.

One of the key techniques used for the efficient use of cloud server resources is virtual machine placement. This work introduces a precise VM placement algorithm that ensures energy efficiency and also prevents Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. The mathematical model of the algorithm is supported by a sophisticated data analytic system implemented as a service. The precision of the algorithm is achieved by allowing each individual VM to build its own data model on demand over an appropriate time horizon. Thus the data model can reflect accurately the characteristics of resource usage of the VM. The algorithm can communicate synchronously or asynchronously with the data analytic service which is deployed as a cloud-based solution. In the experiments, several advanced data modelling and use forecasting techniques were evaluated.

In this paper, we propose a QoS-Guaranteed energy-efficient VM dynamic migration strategy, by taking the user quality of service (QoS) requirements and system load into account. With a more accurate energy consumption model, we first study the effect of system load and user QoS differentiation on the total energy consumption, and then define the migration threshold as a function of the variance of user QoS requirements and system load. We observe that an adaptive migration threshold is beneficial to minimize the total energy consumption, which should be set to be decreased with the growth of system load to lower the variance of user QoS requirements within each PM.

CompVM: A Complementary VM Allocation Mechanism for Cloud Systems,H. Shen; L. Chen,"Computer Science Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,,2018,26,3,1348,1361,"In cloud datacenters, effective resource provisioning is needed to maximize the energy efficiency and utilization of cloud resources while guaranteeing the service-level agreement (SLA) for tenants. To address this need, we propose an initial virtual machine (VM) allocation mechanism (called CompVM) that consolidates complementary VMs with spatial/ temporal awareness. Complementary VMs are the VMs whose total demand of each resource dimension (in the spatial space) nearly reaches their host's capacity during VM lifetime period (in the temporal space). Based on our observation of the existence of VM resource utilization patterns, the mechanism predicts the resource utilization patterns of VMs. Based on the predicted patterns, it coordinates the requirements of different resources and consolidates complementary VMs in the same physical machine (PM). This mechanism reduces the number of PMs needed to provide VM service, hence increases energy efficiency and resource utilization, and also reduces the number of VM migrations and SLA violations. We further propose a utilization variation-based mechanism, a correlation coefficient-based mechanism, and a VM group-based mechanism to match the complementary VMs in order to enhance the VM consolidation performance. Simulation based on two real traces and real-world testbed experiments shows that CompVM significantly reduces the number of PMs used, SLA violations, and VM migrations of the previous resource provisioning strategies.

Besides the huge economical impact Cloud technology exhibits a high potential to be a cornerstone of a new generation of sustainable and energy-efficient ICT. The challenging issue thereby is the energy-efficient utilization of physical machines (PMs) and the resource-efficient management of virtual machines (VMs) while attaining promised non-functional qualities of service expressed by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently, there exist solutions for PM power management, VM migrations, and dynamic reconfiguration of VMs. However, most of the existing approaches consider each of them alone, and only use rudimentary concepts for migration costs or disrespect the nature of the highly volatile workloads. In this paper we present an integrated approach for VM migration and reconfiguration, and PM power management.

While hosts are dominant to consume electric power, networks account for 10 to 20 percent of the total energy costs in a data center. Resource overbooking is one way to reduce the usage of active hosts and networks by placing more requests to the same amount of resources. Network resource overbooking can be facilitated by Software Defined Networking (SDN) that can consolidate traffics and control Quality of Service (QoS) dynamically. However, the existing approaches employ fixed overbooking ratio to decide the amount of resources to be allocated, which in reality may cause excessive Service Level Agreements (SLA) violation with workloads being unpredictable. In this paper, we propose dynamic overbooking strategy which jointly leverages virtualization capabilities and SDN for VM and traffic consolidation. With the dynamically changing workload, the proposed strategy allocates more precise amount of resources to VMs and traffics. This strategy can increase overbooking in a host and network while still providing enough resources to minimize SLA violations. Our approach calculates resource allocation ratio based on the historical monitoring data from the online analysis of the host and network utilization without any pre-knowledge of workloads.

Virtual Machine (VM) migration technology can be applied to reduce energy consumption by consolidating VMs onto the minimal number of servers and turn idle servers into power-saving modes. While most existing energy models consider mainly computing energy, an enhanced energy consumption model is formulated, which includes energy consumption for computation, for servers to switch from standby to active modes, and for communication during VM migrations. Next, two new dynamic VM migration algorithms are proposed. They apply a local regression method to predict potentially over-utilized servers, and the 0-1 knapsack dynamic programming to find the best-fit combination of VMs for migration. The time complexity of these algorithms is analyzed, which indicates that they are highly scalable. Performance is evaluated and compared with existing algorithms.

The growing demand of Cloud infrastructure and modern computational requests like business, scientific and web applications result in large-scale data centers and lead to extra electrical energy consumption. High energy consumption causes high operational cost and also led to high carbon emission which is harmful for atmosphere. Hence, energy-efficient techniques are required to minimize the negative effects of Cloud computing on the environment. Virtual machines (VMs) migration, dynamic consolidation in the virtualized data centers in cloud environments and switching idle physical machines off could yield reduce energy consumption; hence, one of the important issues for energy efficiency in virtualized cloud environments is how to place new VMs or selected VMs for migration across the hosts. In this paper we propose an energy-efficient approach based on Minimum Correlation Coefficient (MCC) method for virtual machine placement in cloud based, virtualized data centers.

Dynamic workload migration over optical backbone network to minimize data center electricity cost,S. Rahman; A. Gupta; M. Tomatore; B. Mukherjee,"University of California, Davis, USA; University of California, Davis, USA; University of California, Davis, USA; University of California, Davis, USA",2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),,2017,,,1,5,"As more organizations rapidly adopt cloud services, energy consumption in data centers (DCs) is increasing such that today Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become a major consumer of energy. A large portion of ICT energy consumption is used to power servers running in DCs and the network they use to communicate. In this study, we consider that, often, energy cost at a particular DC is related to the electricity price regulated by Independent System Operators / Regional Transmission Organizations (ISOs/RTOs). As these prices vary in time and depend on the geographical locations of the DCs, recent studies have shown that the spatio-temporal variations of electricity price can be exploited to reduce electricity cost. While most prior works consider a quasi-static scenario with known workload patterns, our study proposes a dynamic workload-aware algorithm that exploits the spatio-temporal variations of electricity costs with the goal to minimize the energy cost in ICT. Our algorithm uses dynamic request rerouting and live virtual machine (VM) migration to move workloads to DCs with lower electricity cost. We consider VM migration cost (including electricity cost at optical backbone network nodes), bandwidth constraints for migration, VM consolidation, constraints from Service Level Agreement (SLA), and administrative overhead of VM migration.

Then, we present a novel hyper-heuristic algorithm that exploits the benefits of both methods by dynamically finding the best algorithm, according to a user-defined metric.

Many techniques have been devised to help reduce energy consumption for cloud data centers that consist of a large number of identical servers, including dynamic allocation of active servers, consolidating diverse applications, and adjusting the CPU frequency of an active server. However, these techniques normally have a high migration and low resource utilization. CPU and memory is the dominant factors of the performance and energy consumption and whose allocation determines the energy efficiency of cloud system.

An Energy-Aware QoS Enhanced Method for Service Computing across Clouds and Data Centers,W. Dou; X. Xu; S. Meng; S. Yu,NA; NA; NA; NA,2015 Third International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data,,2015,,,80,87,"QoS plays a key role in evaluating a service or a service composition plan across clouds and data centers. Currently, the energy cost of a service's execution is not covered by the QoS framework, and a service's price is often fixed during its execution. However, energy consumption has a great contribution in determining the price of a cloud service. As a result, it is not reasonable if the price of a cloud service is calculated with a fixed energy consumption value, if part of a service's energy consumption could be saved during its execution. Taking advantage of the dynamic energy-aware optimal technique, a QoS enhanced method for service computing is proposed, in this paper, through virtual machine (VM) scheduling. Technically, two typical QoS metrics, i.e., the price and the execution time are taken into consideration in our method. Moreover, our method consists of two dynamic optimal phases. The first optimal phase aims at dynamically benefiting a user with discount price by transparently migrating his or her task execution from a VM located at a server with high energy consumption to a low one. The second optimal phase aims at shortening task's execution time, through transparently migrating a task execution from a VM to another one located at a server with higher performance.

Menaud,"IMT-A, INRIA, LS2N, Nantes, France; CNRS, IRISA, Rennes, France; IMT-A, INRIA, LS2N, Nantes, France","2017 25th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)",,2017,,,1,6,"The consolidation of services is a widely accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, research has focused on strategies for consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the consolidation of services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through consolidation of VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how consolidation of containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects of consolidation of containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the consolidation of VMs. We demonstrate that the consolidation of containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on consolidation of two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters.",1847-358X,978-953-290-078-1978-953-290-074-3978-1-5386-3212,10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115516,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115516,,Containers;Servers;Quality of service;Virtualization;Cloud computing;Virtual machining;Virtual machine monitors,cloud computing;computer centres;quality of service;virtual machines;virtualisation,quality-of-service;QoS;energy-efficiency;energy consumption;energy efficiency;cloud services;VM;EE,,,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The hardware of the datacenter can be get virtualized and create multiple Virtual Machine (VM) instances on a single Physical Machine (PM) in the Cloud computing environment. It is necessary to migrate the VMs from over utilized hosts to ensure the quality of service. Meanwhile the VMs loading on underutilized hosts need to be integrated into a physical machine which usage is in a reasonable range and the system will deactivate that hosts in order to saving power consumption. The key points of VM migration include issues like selecting appropriate VMs for migration at proper time and placement of VMs to suitable hosts. For solving the energy saving and migration issues the Markov-VMMS method is introduced in the paper. In this work the whole migration process is based on Markov chain which is used to predict the value of resource requirement. Extensive simulations have been performed on the cloud computing simulation platform named CloudSim to evaluate the proposed approach. The simulation results show that our approach can better control the energy consumption of the datacenter and enable the PMs provide better service quality.,,978-1-5090-0654-0978-1-5090-0652-6978-1-5090-0655,10.1109/ICALIP.2016.7846628,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846628,Cloud computing;Virtual machine migration;Markov chain;Correlation,Markov processes;Virtual machining;Cloud computing;Resource management;Probability;Quality of service;Servers,cloud computing;computer centres;energy conservation;Markov processes;power consumption;quality of service;telecommunication power management;virtual machines,virtual machine;Markov chain;cloud computing;datacenter;physical machine;quality of service;power consumption;VM migration;energy saving;Markov-VMMS method;CloudSim;energy consumption,,,,16,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Utilization Prediction Aware VM Consolidation Approach for Green Cloud Computing,F. Farahnakian; T. Pahikkala; P. Liljeberg; J. Plosila; H.

Since VM consolidation problem is strictly NP-hard, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle the problem. However, most of the existing works deal only with minimizing the number of hosts based on their current resource utilization and these works do not explore the future resource requirements. Therefore, unnecessary VM migrations are generated and the rate of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations are increased in data centers. To address this problem, our VM consolidation method which is formulated as a bin-packing problem considers both the current and future utilization of resources. The future utilization of resources is accurately predicted using a k-nearest neighbor regression based model.

Currently, one of the critical problems at data centers with many thousands of servers is the increased power consumption. Virtual machines (VMs) are often used for Internet services for efficient server management and provisioning. While we expect that virtualized servers where multiple VMs run help save power, new issues in virtualized servers arise compared to conventional physical servers: migration of the load between servers and processor core assignment of the server's workload from the viewpoints of QoS performance and energy consumption. Our experimental results show that server consolidation using VM migration contributes to power reduction without or with slight QoS performance degradation, and assignment of VMs to multiple processor cores running at a lower frequency can achieve additional power reduction on a server node.",2152-1085;2152-1093,978-1-4244-5148-7978-1-4244-5149,10.1109/GRID.2009.5353054,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5353054,,Web server;Energy consumption;Voice mail;Quality of service;Virtual manufacturing;Virtual machining;Degradation;Cooling;Cloud computing;Power engineering and energy,computer network management;Internet;network servers;performance evaluation;power consumption;quality of service;virtual machines,QoS performance characteristics;virtualized servers;quality of service performance characteristics;virtual machine technology;data centers;power consumption;Internet services;server management;conventional physical servers;energy consumption;server consolidation;power reduction;server node,,13,,14,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Improved Virtual Machine Migration Approaches in Cloud Environment,A. Choudhary; M. C. Govil; G. Singh; L. K. Awasthi; E. S. Pilli; N.

For providing such a scalable environment, cloud provider develops large-scale Cloud Data Centers (CDC). Such CDCs consume a large amount of electrical energy for operational purpose and cooling purpose to keep the machines operating at a right temperature, but it also emits a large amount of carbon-dioxide. Thus to decrease the energy consumption, Virtual Machines (VMs) are consolidated to fewer numbers of active servers through VM migration techniques, this leads to Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation and performance degradation. Therefore to retain the energy-performance tradeoff, we should perform an optimum number of VM migrations. There are two cases when the VM migration performed: First when a hot spot is found and Second when a cold spot is found. But in both the cases we do not directly migrate the VM instead first we check whether it is required to migrate the VM. After that, the algorithm finds an appropriate destination host on which the VM will be migrated. In this paper, we implement three approaches to select destination host: First-fit, Best-fit, and Worst-fit.

Cloud consumers access resources on-demand and with minimum upfront investments into the infrastructure, making cloud cost effective. Central to the cloud paradigm is a virtualization technology whose core is the virtual machine (VM). Hence, the communication capabilities of VMs, whether co-located or otherwise, is paramount, given the critical nature of high performance computing (HPCs) applications. For cloud users, poor VM communication among other things prolongs tenant tasks and VM lease time, ultimately increases costs. More interestingly, poor communication among VM introduces security vulnerabilities. Our analysis indicates that VM communication is mainly discussed from a performance perspective, e.g. quality of service, energy consumption, scheduling, live migration, etc. In contrast, security works are limited, and only focus on intrusion and anomaly detection, and integrity and trust logging. In this paper, we thus analyse Xen-based VM technologies communication. To the best of our knowledge, no paper offers a comprehensive analysis of VM communication from a security perspective. We propose and construct scenario-based hypothesis to extract interesting communication sequences. We achieve this by introducing trigger scenarios for each communication hypothesis.

Quality of Service Channelling for Latency Sensitive Edge Applications,A. Aral; I.

To avoid this limitation deteriorating response time which is critical for Edge applications, use of proactive optimization algorithms is essential. Such proactive algorithms, however, require an accurate method for estimating availability of a VM that runs on a certain EDC. Estimation is complicated by several dependent and independent probabilistic events (e.g. hardware, software or network failures, power outage, etc.) that affect VM availability in different levels. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Network model of QoS related parameters to estimate availability level of a VM in Edge infrastructure. We compare our approach to other machine learning methods and to the common practice in reliability theory that is the use of prior failure probability.

SageShift: Managing SLAs for highly consolidated cloud,O. Sukwong; A. Sangpetch; H. S. Kim,"Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA USA",2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,,2012,,,208,216,"Maximizing consolidation ratio, the number of virtual machines (VMs) in a physical machine, without violating customers' SLAs is an important goal in the cloud. We show that it is difficult to achieve this goal with existing hypervisor schedulers. The schedulers control only the amount of resource allocation, but not the sequence of VM execution. This sequence can significantly impact the response time when requests arrive concurrently for the VMs sharing the same CPU. We find that the response time can increase as much as 100% for every additional VM in the system, even if the utilization does not exceed the maximum capacity. Therefore, existing schedulers have to reduce the consolidation ratio to meet SLAs. Previous resource-provisioning works rely on existing schedulers that cannot guarantee SLAs without reducing the consolidation ratio. We propose SageShift, a system that can achieve SLAs without penalizing the consolidation ratio. SageShift consists of a VM admission control - Sage, and a hypervisor scheduler - Shift. To admit a VM, Sage assesses feasibility of its SLA based on the patterns of incoming requests. Shift maintains the admitted SLAs by adjusting both the amount of resource allocation and the sequence of VM execution. The dynamic adjustment is based on the observed response time and the SLAs. We modify the KVM scheduler in Linux kernel to implement Shift. We show that Shift can improve the consolidation ratio by 66% without compromising the SLAs. Under bursty incoming requests, Shift maintains all SLAs within 3% of the percentile target. But existing schedulers in VMware ESXi, Xen and KVM fail to meet one or more SLAs with up to 33% below the percentile target. Shift is also work-conserving. It allows best-effort VMs to run in the background in order to maximize hardware utilization without impacting SLAs.",0743-166X;0743-166X,978-1-4673-0775-8978-1-4673-0773-4978-1-4673-0774,10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195591,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195591,Dynamic scheduling;Virtual machine monitors;Quality of service;Admission control;Web services,Time factors;Virtual machine monitors;Resource management;Kernel;Admission control;Linux,cloud computing;Linux;processor scheduling;resource allocation;virtual machines,SageShift;SLA management;highly consolidated cloud;consolidation ratio maximization;virtual machines;customer SLA violation;hypervisor schedulers;resource allocation;VM execution;CPU sharing;resource-provisioning works;VM admission control;KVM scheduler;Linux kernel;VMware ESXi;Xen;hardware utilization maximization;service level agreement,,15,,31,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
SLA-based Optimization of Power and Migration Cost in Cloud Computing,H. Goudarzi; M. Ghasemazar; M. Pedram,NA; NA; NA,"2012 12th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (ccgrid 2012)",,2012,,,172,179,"Cloud computing systems (or hosting datacenters) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Utility computing, reliable data storage, and infrastructure-independent computing are example applications of such systems. Electrical energy cost of a cloud computing system is a strong function of the consolidation and migration techniques used to assign incoming clients to existing servers. Moreover, each client typically has a service level agreement (SLA), which specifies constraints on performance and/or quality of service that it receives from the system. These constraints result in a basic trade-off between the total energy cost and client satisfaction in the system. In this paper, a resource allocation problem is considered that aims to minimize the total energy cost of cloud computing system while meeting the specified client-level SLAs in a probabilistic sense. The cloud computing system pays penalty for the percentage of a client's requests that do not meet a specified upper bound on their service time.

Green Cloud Broker: On-line Dynamic Virtual Machine Placement Across Multiple Cloud Providers,F. Larumbe; B. Sansò,NA; NA,2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet),,2016,,,119,125,"Cloud computing controls the increasing energy consumption of applications by consolidating them in shared servers through virtualization. This technique can be greatly improved and complemented by choosing an optimal data center for each Virtual Machine (VM). That dynamic optimization problem was stated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that minimizes operational expenditures, while respecting constraints on Quality of Service (QoS), power consumption, and CO<sub>2</sub>emissions. Geographically distributed users experience varying response times depending on where users and VMs are located. Users closer to VMs experience a shorter response time, thus distributing VMs close to users improves the QoS. On the other hand, the increasing energy consumption of the cloud raised concerns about the impact on CO<sub>2</sub>emissions and global warming. Placing VMs in data centers that use green energy sources is an important way to mitigate this problem. A comprehensive optimization modelling framework and an efficient tabu search heuristic were developed to handle applications with dynamic demands in real time. Test cases had more than 1,000 nodes, 650 applications, and 6,500 VMs. Results report that the communication delay is reduced up to 6 times, 30% of power consumption is saved, and the CO<sub>2</sub>emissions can be reduced up to 60 times.

Several schemes have been proposed for this purpose; and these include online migration and VM placement - which can offer the best in terms of resource utilization. The consolidation process can be made effective by finding “opportunities” to migrate VMs as well approximating the resource utilization for the VM placement. An inefficient placement scheme, however, will lead to a substantial overloading of physical machines. This proposed VM placement scheme uses correlation coefficient and predicted future requirements of computing resources to accurately compute the value/s of variable, and has been termed LIFE - Lowest Interdependence Factor Exponent. This variable shows the extent to which a VM can be associated with a target physical machine. Higher value of LIFE will correspondingly result in a larger impact factor influencing the performance of existing VMs whenever a VM is selected for migration to a target machine. To minimize performance degradation, migration of a VM to a target machine will only take place if it is found to correspond with a value of LIFE that is found to be the lowest.

Though existing works achieve optimization to a certain extent, most of them do not take the overall resource utilization balancing into account. In this paper, heuristic greedy algorithms are proposed based on a novel conception, ""Healthy Threshold"".

Multiagent-Based Resource Allocation for Energy Minimization in Cloud Computing Systems,W. Wang; Y. Jiang; W. Wu,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",,2017,47,2,205,220,"Cloud computing has emerged as a very flexible service paradigm by allowing users to require virtual machine (VM) resources on-demand and allowing cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide VM resources via a pay-as-you-go model. This paper addresses the CSP's problem of efficiently allocating VM resources to physical machines (PMs) with the aim of minimizing the energy consumption. Traditional energy-aware VM allocations either allocate VMs to PMs in a centralized manner or implement VM migrations for energy reduction without considering the migration cost in cloud computing systems. We address these two issues by introducing a decentralized multiagent (MA)-based VM allocation approach. The proposed MA works by first dispatching a cooperative agent to each PM to assist the PM in managing VM resources. Then, an auction-based VM allocation mechanism is designed for these agents to decide the allocations of VMs to PMs. Moreover, to tackle system dynamics and avoid incurring prohibitive VM migration overhead, a local negotiation-based VM consolidation mechanism is devised for the agents to exchange their assigned VMs for energy cost saving. We evaluate the efficiency of the MA approach by using both static and dynamic simulations. The static experimental results demonstrate that the MA can incur acceptable computation time to reduce system energy cost compared with traditional bin packing and genetic algorithm-based centralized approaches. In the dynamic setting, the energy cost of the MA is similar to that of benchmark global-based VM consolidation approaches, but the MA largely reduces the migration cost.",2168-2216;2168-2232,,10.1109/TSMC.2016.2523910,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars of the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Program for Distinguished Talents of Six Domains in Jiangsu Province; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7416240,Cloud computing systems;energy cost;migration cost;multiagent (MA);negotiation;resource allocation,Resource management;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Minimization;Dynamic scheduling;Biological cells,cloud computing;energy conservation;energy consumption;multi-agent systems;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtual machines,multiagent-based resource allocation;energy consumption minimization;cloud computing systems;virtual machine resources;VM resources;cloud service providers;CSP;pay-as-you-go model;physical machines;energy-aware VM allocations;energy reduction;decentralized multiagent based VM allocation;cooperative agent;dynamic simulations;static simulations;energy cost saving;local negotiation-based VM consolidation;VM migration overhead;system dynamics;auction-based VM allocation,,5,,57,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

In this paper, we have proposed a prediction based migration technique for the VMs, where we perform VM migrations based on the predicted CPU utilization. Extensive simulations show that the proposed technique substantially reduces energy consumption, number of VM migrations and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations within a data center. The performance overheads associated with excessive migration of VMs increase the time needed by the VMs to complete their jobs. So in this paper, we have also proposed a deadline aware VM migration technique, which reduces the time taken by the VMs to execute their jobs significantly, thereby improving the Quality of Service (QoS).

Correctly consolidating VMs' workloads for a large scale cloud computing platform is nontrivial because a shortsighted scheme may save some cost in one aspect but becomes expensive in other aspects being neglected. In this paper, we present a framework that automates the VM consolidation process to improve the VMs and servers assignment whenever such improvement is possible. The proposed VM consolidation framework can achieve a balance among multiple administrative objectives (e.g., power cost, network cost) during the VM consolidation process. The solution method of solving the VM consolidation problem is designed based on the powerful and efficient semi quasi M-convex optimization framework.

The number of active hosts can be reduced according to the resources requirements using live migration in order to minimize the power consumption in this technology. However, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) is essential for maintaining reliable quality of service between data centers and their users in the cloud environment. Therefore, reduction of the SLA violation level and power costs are considered as two objectives in this paper. We present a CPU usage prediction method based on the linear regression technique. The proposed approach approximates the short-time future CPU utilization based on the history of usage in each host. It is employed in the live migration process to predict over-loaded and under-loaded hosts. When a host becomes over-loaded, some VMs migrate to other hosts to avoid SLA violation. Moreover, first all VMs migrate from a host while it becomes under-loaded. Then, the host switches to the sleep mode for reducing power consumption.

Performance and Energy-Based Cost Prediction of Virtual Machines Auto-Scaling in Clouds,M. Aldossary; K.

It is imperative for public cloud providers to guarantee performance targets for tenants' VMs while respecting strict business confidentiality, e.g., having no information on applications nor their performance. A large body of related work addresses the challenges of detecting performance interferences by leveraging client's quality of service (QoS) metrics, such as latency, and additional profiling servers. Whereas to assist cloud providers, we resort to an on-line blackbox approach based on throttling that detects a wide range of resource contentions with no cooperation need from the virtual machines. We focus on different resource metrics and actively monitor them from the hypervisor in fine time granularity at low cost. To detect resource contention, we propose a three-phase algorithm: an alarm phase, to identify statistical outliers in the victim's VM resource metrics; a passive diagnosis phase, to match the current sample to historical behaviors; and, an active learning phase, to discern contentions from application phase changes via throttling. We evaluate our algorithm on a prototype running Wikimedia as victim application across a set of VMs collocated with neighboring VMs running resource hoggers, i.e. PARSEC and Cachebench.

Gokhale,NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing,,2014,,,48,55,"Power and performance tradeoffs are critical and challenging issues faced by cloud service providers (CSPs) while managing their data centers. On the one hand, CSPs strive to reduce power consumption of their data centers to not only decrease their energy costs but to also reduce adverse impact on the environment. On the other hand, CSPs must deliver performance expected by the applications hosted in their cloud in accordance with predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Not doing so will lead to loss of customers and thereby major revenue losses for the CSPs. Addressing these dual set of challenges is hard for the CSPs because power management and performance assurance are conflicting objectives, particularly in the context of multi-tenant cloud systems where multiple virtual machines (VMs) may be hosted on a single physical server. The problem becomes even harder when real-time applications are hosted in these VMs. To address these challenges and make appropriate tradeoffs, we present iPlace, which is an intelligent and tunable power- and performance-aware VM placement middleware. The placement strategy is based on a two-level artificial neural network which predicts (1) CPU usage at the first level, and (2) power consumption and performance of a host machine at the second level that uses the predicted CPU usage.

Cloud and Energy Management -- Issues and Concerns,P. H. Shuttleworth,NA,"2015 9th International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies",,2015,,,365,369,"The emergence of Cloud Computing has dramatically shaped the provision of computing services to consumers. Global, large scale deployments of Cloud infrastructure services have fundamentally changed the way in which we use IT services today. Businesses are now able to convert capital costs into operating expenses in order to reduce financial risk, which in turn, has resulted in a significant increase in the take-up of Cloud based services. However, this has in turn transferred considerable infrastructure costs onto Cloud Service Providers (CSP). The operational costs of large Cloud Data Centers (CDC) are significant, with the provision of energy a large proportion of this expense. The efficient management of energy, and the concept of Green Computing in general, is high on the agenda for CSPs. Cloud services, with their application in 'Smart Cities', offer an attractive reduction of expenses and resource consumption. This, coupled with the ability to rapidly and dynamically commit computational power on demand, means that the management of energy in CDCs is of substantial concern to cities aiming to develop 'smart' urban growth within their centers. This paper investigates the issues and concerns regarding energy management in Cloud Computing, by reviewing existing published research papers and literature in the field. The paper then identifies a key publication which introduces the concept of a ""Green Cloud Framework' and Virtual Machine Scheduling and Management as a key energy efficiency issue.

DPack: Disk scheduler for highly consolidated cloud,O. Sukwong; H. S. Kim,"Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA USA; Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA USA",2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,,2013,,,30,34,"Virtualization allows us to consolidate multiple servers onto a single physical machine, saving infrastructure cost. Yet, consolidation can lead to performance degradation, jeopardizing Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze and identify the factors to the performance degradation due to consolidation - that is the wait time and the ready time. The wait time is the queuing time caused by other virtual machines (VMs). The ready time is the time the resource takes to be ready to service, such as the seek time incurred in traditional storage. The ready time can substantially deteriorate the request response time. Unfortunately, existing schedulers can only manage the wait time, but not the ready time. To control both quantities, we propose an adaptive disk scheduler called DPack. DPack schedules the VMs based on the likelihood of the VM failing the SLAs. DPack then adjusts the exclusive access time based on the VM resource access prediction. DPack considers the workload changes and request arrival to enhance robustness. We develop DPack based on the default disk scheduler in KVM and evaluate it against several existing disk schedulers available in KVM and Xen. The results show that DPack can improve the 99th percentile response time up to 76%.

However, existing work controls power and application-level performance separately and thus cannot simultaneously provide explicit guarantees on both. This paper proposes Co-Con, a novel cluster-level control architecture that coordinates individual power and performance control loops for virtualized server clusters. To emulate the current practice in data centers, the power control loop changes hardware power states with no regard to the application-level performance. The performance control loop is then designed for each virtual machine to achieve the desired performance even when the system model varies significantly due to the impact of power control. Co-Con configures the two control loops rigorously, based on feedback control theory, for theoretically guaranteed control accuracy and system stability. Empirical results demonstrate that Co-Con can simultaneously provide effective control on both application-level performance and underlying power consumption.",1548-615X,978-1-4244-3875-4978-1-4244-3876,10.1109/IWQoS.2009.5201388,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5201388,,Application virtualization;Control systems;Energy consumption;Power control;Delay;Throughput;Hardware;Virtual machining;Power system modeling;Feedback control,computer centres;power aware computing;power system control;virtual machines,Co-Con;coordinated power control;virtualized server cluster;data center;service-level agreement;server power consumption;server density;cluster-level control architecture;performance control loop;power control loop;virtual machine;feedback control theory;system stability,,10,,28,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
SmartShuffle: Managing Online Virtual Machine Shuffle in Virtualized Data Centers,P. Zhang; H. Wang; J. li; J. Dong; Y. Li; S. Cheng,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops,,2013,,,113,118,"Virtual machine (VM) live migration provides spatial flexibility by rearranging VM placement (i.e., VM shuffle) in several scenarios, including server consolidation, power consumption saving, fault tolerance, QoS management and network congestion resolving. However, VM live migration would consume scarce bandwidth and even cause network congestion. Since the bandwidth used by VM migration is usually the same as the services running in the VM, migration traffic would dominate network path and affect other application traffic as the traffic of a VM migration is usually several GBs. It gets worse in VM shuffle where plenty of VMs are needed to be moved. In this paper, we explore the opportunity to manage online VM shuffle and minimize the impact to data center networks. An efficient online VM shuffle scheduling method named SmartShuffle is presented. SmartShuffle tries to minimize the VM shuffle duration by coordinating VM migration in a proper scheduling order. VMs benefiting others maximally are migrated preferentially. We employ the simulated annealing algorithm to search for a solution for SmartShuffle. Our evaluation shows that SmartShuffle decreases the shuffle duration dramatically.",1545-0678;2332-5666,978-1-4799-3248-1978-1-4799-3247,10.1109/ICDCSW.2013.51,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6679873,cloud computing;virtualized datacenter;virtual machine live migration;virtual machine shuffle;scheduling,Servers;Bandwidth;Simulated annealing;Traffic control;Processor scheduling;Algorithm design and analysis,computer centres;simulated annealing;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;virtualisation,SmartShuffle;online virtual machine shuffle management;virtualized data centers;virtual machine live migration;VM live migration;spatial flexibility;VM placement;server consolidation;power consumption saving;fault tolerance;QoS management;network congestion resolving;migration traffic;application traffic;online VM shuffle management;online VM shuffle scheduling method;VM shuffle duration minimization;simulated annealing algorithm,,2,,15,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, the aggressive consolidation of virtual machines may lead to service-level agreements (SLA) violation, which is essential for data centers and their users. Therefore, it is very meaningful to strike a tradeoff between power efficient and reduction of SLA violation level. In this paper, we propose a host overloading/underloading detection algorithm and a new VM placement algorithm based on our proposed robust simple linear regression prediction model for SLA-aware and energy-efficient consolidation of virtual machines in cloud data centers. Different from the native linear regression, our proposed methods amend the prediction and squint toward over-prediction by adding the error to the prediction; in this paper, we propose eight methods to calculate the error.

Customer-aware resource overallocation to improve energy efficiency in realtime Cloud Computing data centers,I. S. Moreno; J. Xu,"School of Computing, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK; School of Computing, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK",2011 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications (SOCA),,2011,,,1,8,"Energy efficiency is becoming a very important concern for Cloud Computing environments. These are normally composed of large and power consuming data centers to provide the required elasticity and scalability to their customers. In this context, many efforts have been developed to balance the loads at host level. However, determining how to maximize the resources utilization at Virtual Machine (VM) level still remains as a big challenge. This is mainly driven by very dynamic workload behaviors and a wide variety of customers' resource utilization patterns. This paper introduces a dynamic resource provisioning mechanism to overallocate the capacity of real-time Cloud data centers based on customer utilization patterns. Furthermore, its impact on the trade-off between energy efficiency and SLA fulfillment is analyzed. The main idea is to exploit the resource utilization patterns of each customer to decrease the waste produced by resource request overestimations. This creates the opportunity to allocate additional VMs in the same host incrementing its energy efficiency. Nevertheless, this also increases the risk of QoS affectations. The proposed model considers SLA deadlines, predictions based on historical data, and dynamic occupation to determine the amount of resources to overallocate for each host. In addition, a compensation mechanism to adjust resource allocation in cases of underestimation is also described. In order to evaluate the model, simulation experimentation was conducted. Results demonstrate meaningful improvements in energy-efficiency while SLA-deadlines are slightly impacted. However, they also point the importance of strongest compensation policies to reduce availability violations especially during peak utilization periods.",2163-2871,978-1-4673-0319-4978-1-4673-0318-7978-1-4673-0317,10.1109/SOCA.2011.6166239,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6166239,cloud computing;real-time cloud computing;energy-efficiency;overallocation;overbooking;customer-aware;green computing;energy-aware provisioning,Cloud computing;Energy efficiency;Resource management;Real time systems;Servers;Computational modeling;Prediction algorithms,cloud computing;computer centres;customer services;energy conservation;power aware computing;quality of service;real-time systems;resource allocation;virtual machines,customer-aware resource overallocation;energy efficiency;real-time data centers;cloud computing;load balancing;customer resource utilization pattern;virtual machine;dynamic resource provisioning mechanism;SLA;QoS;resource allocation,,9,,33,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

A Trust and Reputation System for Energy Optimization in Cloud Data Centers,I. Aransay; M. Zapater; P. Arroba; J. M. Moya,NA; NA; NA; NA,2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing,,2015,,,138,145,"The increasing success of Cloud Computing applications and online services has contributed to the unsustainability of data center facilities in terms of energy consumption. Higher resource demand has increased the electricity required by computation and cooling resources, leading to power shortages and outages, specially in urban infrastructures. Current energy reduction strategies for Cloud facilities usually disregard the data center topology, the contribution of cooling consumption and the scalability of optimization strategies. Our work tackles the energy challenge by proposing a temperature-aware VM allocation policy based on a Trust-and-Reputation System (TRS). A TRS meets the requirements for inherently distributed environments such as data centers, and allows the implementation of autonomous and scalable VM allocation techniques. For this purpose, we model the relationships between the different computational entities, synthesizing this information in one single metric. This metric, called reputation, would be used to optimize the allocation of VMs in order to reduce energy consumption. We validate our approach with a state-of-the-art Cloud simulator using real Cloud traces. Our results show considerable reduction in energy consumption, reaching up to 46.16% savings in computing power and 17.38% savings in cooling, without QoS degradation while keeping servers below thermal redlining.

Moreover, the applicability of free cooling is further restricted along with the conservative assumption on workload characteristics and the virtual machine (VM) consolidation technique as they require to provision higher cooling capability. This paper presents a dynamic power management scheme, which extends the applicability of free cooling by judiciously consolidating VMs exploiting time-varying workload characteristics of datacenter as well as climate conditions, in order to minimize the power consumption of the entire datacenter while satisfying service-level agreement (SLA) requirements.

Cesario,NA; NA,"2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)",,2017,,,1062,1069,"The steadily increasing success of Cloud Computing is causing a huge rise in its electrical power consumption, contributing to higher energy costs, as well as to the greenhouse effect and the global warming. One of the most common key strategies to reduce the power consumption of data centers is the consolidation of virtual machines, whose effectiveness strongly depends on a reliable forecasting of future computational resource needs. In fact, servers are typically configured to handle peak workload conditions even if they are often under-utilized, that results in a wastefulness of resources and inefficient energy consumption. Motivated by these issues, this paper describes a data-driven approach based on auto-regressive models to dynamically forecast virtual machine workloads, for energy-aware allocations of virtual machines on Cloud physical nodes. Virtual machine migrations across physical servers are periodically done on the basis of the estimated virtual machine demands, by minimizing the number of active servers.

In this paper, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to manage the dynamic mapping of VMs to physical resources in cloud data center. The main decisions required to solve this problem are when, which and where to move VMs. The decisions of when to migrate VMs are based on the sliding-window and the thresholds, the decisions of which VMs to be migrated are based on the different VM selection strategies, and the decisions of where to migrate VMs are based on the TOPSIS in order to balance the conflict between different objectives.

Migration-less Energy-Aware Task Scheduling Policies in Cloud Environments,S. Hosseinimotlagh; F. Khunjush; S. Hosseinimotlagh,NA; NA; NA,2014 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops,,2014,,,391,397,"Burgeoning market for cloud applications has brought significant interest for cloud providers. They look for methods to maximize their profit margins by executing higher number of jobs while minimizing the operational costs and environmental footprints. Energy consumption of servers plays a crucial role in operational costs. There have been different methods to deal with energy consumption from hardware level to higher layers of abstractions such as compilers and operating systems. For example, several resource-scheduling policies have been proposed to not only regulate energy consumption but also guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA). One of the prevalent techniques in reducing the total energy consumption in data-centers is through consolidation of virtual machines (VMs). In this technique, one or several VMs migrate from a physical node to other nodes, which in turn incurs a significant overhead not only on a server but also on the network infrastructure of a cloud. To address this problem, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the unsurpassed utilization level to come up with optimal energy consumption while meeting a given QoS. In other words, our proposed algorithm aims to regulate execution speeds of VMs on a host with a result that the host works at its optimal energy level. In fact, a host is scheduled to run its allocated tasks faster to reach the optimum level of utilization instead of migrating its tasks to other hosts. We also propose several task scheduling policies to adjust execution speeds for real-time tasks in each VM. The simulation results show that the proposed task scheduling policies not only reduce the total energy consumption of a cloud by 19%, but also have profound impacts on turnaround times of real-time tasks by 27%.",,978-1-4799-2653-4978-1-4799-2652,10.1109/WAINA.2014.66,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844669,,Energy consumption;Scheduling;Scheduling algorithms;Power demand;Educational institutions;Real-time systems,cloud computing;power aware computing;virtual machines,QoS;VM scheduling algorithm;virtual machine;SLA;service level agreement;resource-scheduling policy;energy consumption;cloud environment;migration-less energy-aware task scheduling policy,,7,,32,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Recently, various approaches have been developed to effectively reduce GPU power consumption by making GPU run at low frequencies. However, virtual machines (VMs) running on the same physical GPU with virtualization technology are correlated, because the change of GPU frequencies will affect the SLA performance of all the VMs. In fact, both reducing power consumption and guaranteeing SLA should work together under the considerations of their correlations. This paper proposes a novel two-layer control architecture called energy-efficient SLA guarantees for virtualized GPU (EvGPU) based on well-established feedback control techniques. The first control loop adopts a proportional-integral (PI) controller to ensure SLA guarantees, which in particular are measured at a predefined level of the frames per second (FPS) for each online game. The secondary power control loop then adjusts GPU frequency through dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) to reduce power consumption based on the current FPS achieved by the first loop.

Consolidating complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness in cloud datacenters,L. Chen; H.

Previous resource provisioning strategies either allocate physical resources to virtual machines (VMs) based on static VM resource demands or dynamically handle the variations in VM resource requirements through live VM migrations. However, the former fail to maximize energy efficiency and resource utilization while the latter produce high migration overhead. To handle these problems, we propose an initial VM allocation mechanism that consolidates complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness. Complementary VMs are the VMs whose total demand of each resource dimension (in the spatial space) nearly reaches their host's capacity during VM lifetime period (in the temporal space). Based on our observation of the existence of VM resource utilization patterns, the mechanism predicts the lifetime resource utilization patterns of short-term VMs or periodical resource utilization patterns of long-term VMs. Based on the predicted patterns, it coordinates the requirements of different resources and consolidates complementary VMs in the same physical machine (PM). This mechanism reduces the number of PMs needed to provide VM service hence increases energy efficiency and resource utilization and also reduces the number of VM migrations and SLA violations. Simulation based on two real traces and real-world testbed experiments show that our initial VM allocation mechanism significantly reduces the number of PMs used, SLA violations and VM migrations of the previous resource provisioning strategies.",0743-166X,978-1-4799-3360,10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848033,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848033,,Resource management;Computers;Google;Conferences;Radio access networks;Virtual machining;Bandwidth,cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;resource allocation;virtual machines,virtual machines;cloud datacenters;resource provisioning;service level agreement;SLA;physical resource allocation;VM allocation mechanism;VM resource utilization patterns;physical machine;PM;complementary VM consolidation,,43,,25,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In the paper, we investigate the impact of Virtualization technology on the energy and performance in data center environment taking into consideration various factors such as server failures and the overhead introduced by the VM contention. Noticing that there exits a tradeoff between energy consumption and execution time, we propose a stochastic model of data centers using Queueing theory to optimize performance and energy consumption. From the data center operators' prospective, they are willing to do better business by saving the energy consumption while abiding by the SLAs.

However, several challenges remain to be addressed. Scaling up the infrastructure to match up the resource demand of the users is relatively straight forward. However in order to save up on power consumption, cloud providers have to dynamically consolidate the virtual machines (VM), so that only a reduced subset of hosts remains powered on. To solve this issue, the cloud scheduler, which handles the VM allocations, has to balance between providing enough resource to each user, and reducing the overall power consumption of the cloud. In this paper we investigate the VM allocation and reallocation inside a cloud in order to save energy while maintaining the resources required by users. Such actions have to be made in order to minimize the number of hosts powered on, while limiting concurrent migrations of virtual machines, and in a reasonable computational time.

The focus of this paper is on the virtual machine (VM) consolidation in a cloud computing system as a way of lowering daily energy consumption of the system. In contrast to the existing works that assume resource demands of VMs are known and given as scalar variables, this paper treats these demands as random variables with known means and standard deviations. These random variables may be correlated with one another, and there are several kinds of resources which can be performance bottlenecks. Therefore, both the correlation and multiple resource type should be considered. The VM consolidation problem is then formulated as a multi-capacity stochastic bin packing problem.

Prevent VM Migration in Virtualized Clusters via Deadline Driven Placement Policy,M. Tsai; J. Chou; J.

It relies on VM migration to move user applications or jobs onto fewer numbers of physical servers during off peak hour. However, VM migration is a costly operation that could cause several concerns, such as performance degradation and system instability. Most existing works were proposed to minimize the migration cost for dynamic consolidation which migrates VM at the runtime when SLA violation or resource under-utilization is detected. In contrast, this paper aims to proactively prevent VM migration for semi-static VM consolidation by proposing a deadline driven VM placement strategy based on the awareness of the server turn-off time and job execution time. We evaluate our approach using a real HPC cluster trace as well as a set of synthetic generated workloads.

For this purpose, the bandwidths of the multiple wireless network interface cards of the wireless devices may be aggregated under the control of the emerging MultiPathTCP (MPTCP) protocol. However, due to the fading and mobility-induced phenomena, the energy consumptions of the current state-of-the-art VM migration techniques may still offset their expected benefits. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we analytically characterize and implement in software and numerically test the optimal minimum-energy settable-complexity bandwidth manager (SCBM) for the live migration of VMs over 5G FOGRAN MPTCP connections. The key features of the proposed SCBM are that: 1) its implementation complexity is settable on-line on the basis of the target energy consumption versus implementation complexity tradeoff; 2) it minimizes the network energy consumed by the wireless device for sustaining the migration process under hard constraints on the tolerated migration times and downtimes; and 3) by leveraging a suitably designed adaptive mechanism, it is capable to quickly react to (possibly, unpredicted) fading and/or mobility-induced abrupt changes of the wireless environment without requiring forecasting.

In this paper, we show that, besides energy consumption, service level agreement(SLA) violations also severely degrade the cost-efficiency of data centers. We present online VM placement algorithms for increasing cloud provider's revenue. First, First-Fit and Harmonic algorithm are devised for VM placement without considering migrations. Both algorithms get the same performance in the worst-case analysis, and equal to the lower bound of the competitive ratio. However, Harmonic algorithm could create more revenue than First-Fit by more than 10 percent when job arriving rate is greater than 1.0. Second, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing revenue from VM migration, and prove it as NP-Hard by a reduction from 3-Partition problem. Therefore, we propose two heuristics: Least-Reliable-First (LRF) and Decreased-Density-Greedy (DDG). Experiments demonstrate that DDG yields more revenue than LRF when migration cost is low, yet leads to losses when SLA penalty is low or job arriving rate is high, due to the large number of migrations.

Energy-Aware Scheduling in Virtualized Datacenters,I. Goiri; F. Julia; R. Nou; J. L. Berral; J. Guitart; J. Torres,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2010 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing,,2010,,,58,67,"The reduction of energy consumption in large-scale datacenters is being accomplished through an extensive use of virtualization, which enables the consolidation of multiple workloads in a smaller number of machines. Nevertheless, virtualization also incurs some additional overheads (e.g. virtual machine creation and migration) that can influence what is the best consolidated configuration, and thus, they must be taken into account. In this paper, we present a dynamic job scheduling policy for power-aware resource allocation in a virtualized datacenter. Our policy tries to consolidate workloads from separate machines into a smaller number of nodes, while fulfilling the amount of hardware resources needed to preserve the quality of service of each job. This allows turning off the spare servers, thus reducing the overall datacenter power consumption. As a novelty, this policy incorporates all the virtualization overheads in the decision process. In addition, our policy is prepared to consider other important parameters for a datacenter, such as reliability or dynamic SLA enforcement, in a synergistic way with power consumption. The introduced policy is evaluated comparing it against common policies in a simulated environment that accurately models HPC jobs execution in a virtualized datacenter including power consumption modeling and obtains a power consumption reduction of 15% with respect to typical policies.",1552-5244;2168-9253,978-1-4244-8373-0978-0-7695-4220,10.1109/CLUSTER.2010.15,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5600320,Virtualization;HPC;Energy;SLA;Scheduling,Power demand;Reliability;Resource management;Servers;Optimization;Hardware;Dynamic scheduling,computer centres;energy consumption;power aware computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines,energy-aware scheduling;virtualized datacenter;energy consumption reduction;dynamic job scheduling policy;power-aware resource allocation;dynamic SLA enforcement;power consumption modeling;power consumption reduction,,38,,31,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Proactive Workload Consolidation for Reducing Energy Cost over a Given Time Horizon,M. D. Cauwer; D. Mehta; B. OSullivan; H. Simonis; H. Cambazard,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"2014 14th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",,2014,,,558,561,"Data centre energy requirements have grown massively in the last few years. One of the optimisation challenges for reducing its energy requirements is to keep servers well utilised by deciding which Virtual Machines (VMs) to migrate, where to migrate, when to migrate, and, when and which servers to switch on/off. Achieving this goal optimally requires the capability of predicting the future time-variable resource demands of VMs accurately and computing the plan for migrating VMs for efficient workload consolidation quickly. We call this Proactive Workload Consolidation Problem (PWCP). Solving PWCP as a giant monolithic problem with infinite time windows is impossible both for forecasting demands and optimal assignments of VMs to servers. We formulate PWCP in a more realistic way by defining a time window of a particular size in which the information is known more accurately and solve a - possibly infinite - sequence of optimisation problems moving forwards in time. The question is how far one is required to look ahead in terms of the number time-periods and still retain the minimum energy cost of a given horizon without violating the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). We perform investigations to understand the relationship between the number of time-periods considered in one optimisation step and migration-limits on the SLAs, energy cost, server-transition cost and migration cost. Our results suggest that looking ahead by only a few more time-periods can lead to more efficient resource provisioning over the entire horizon and consequently higher energy efficiency and close to no SLA violations.",,978-1-4799-2784,10.1109/CCGrid.2014.105,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846500,,Servers;Optimization;Computational modeling;Virtual machining;Quality of service;Electricity;Memory management,computer centres;contracts;cost reduction;resource allocation;virtual machines,proactive workload consolidation problem;energy cost reduction;time horizon;data centre energy requirements;virtual machines;VM;time-variable resource demands;PWCP;infinite time windows;service level agreements;SLA;server-transition cost;migration cost;resource provisioning,,1,,4,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Enhancing Cloud Energy Models for Optimizing Datacenters Efficiency,E. Outin; J. Dartois; O. Barais; J.

More generally, the provider attempts to optimize resource utilization. However, while minimizing expenses, the Cloud operator still needs to conform to SLA constraints negotiated with customers (such as latency, downtime, affinity, placement, response time or duplication). Consequently, optimizing a Cloud configuration is a multi-objective problem. As a nontrivial multi-objective optimization problem, there does not exist a single solution that simultaneously optimizes each objective. There exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions. Evolutionary algorithms are popular approaches for generating Pareto optimal solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. Most of these solutions use a fitness function to assess the quality of the candidates. However, regarding the energy consumption estimation, the fitness function can be approximative and lead to some imprecisions compared to the real observed data. This paper presents a system that uses a genetic algorithm to optimize Cloud energy consumption and machine learning techniques to improve the fitness function regarding a real distributed cluster of server.

To achieve improved energy efficiency, request batching can be conducted to group received requests into batches and put the processor into sleep between the batches. However, it is challenging to perform request batching on a virtualized server because different virtual machines on the same server may have different workload intensities. Hence, putting the shared processor into sleep may severely impact the performance of all the virtual machines. This paper proposes Virtual Batching, a novel request batching solution for virtualized servers with primarily light workloads. Our solution dynamically allocates CPU resources such that all the virtual machines can have approximately the same performance level relative to their allowed peak values. Based on this uniform level, our solution determines the time length for periodically batching incoming requests and putting the processor into sleep. When the workload intensity changes from light to moderate, request batching is automatically switched to DVFS to increase processor frequency for performance guarantees. Empirical results based on a hardware testbed and real trace files show that Virtual Batching can achieve the desired performance with more energy conservation than several well-designed baselines, e.g., 63% more, on average, than a solution based on DVFS only.",1548-615X;1548-615X,978-1-4244-5986-5978-1-4244-5987-2978-1-4244-5988,10.1109/IWQoS.2010.5542736,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542736,,Virtual machining;Frequency;Energy management;Dynamic voltage scaling;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Resource management;Hardware;Testing;Energy conservation,batch processing (computers);energy conservation;energy consumption;file servers;power aware computing;processor scheduling;virtual machines,energy conservation;power management;virtualized server;enterprise server;dynamic voltage scaling;dynamic frequency scaling;virtual batching;virtual machine,,6,,33,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Electricity Cost Minimization in Distributed Clouds by Exploring Heterogeneity of Cloud Resources and User Demands,Z. Xu; W. Liang; Q. Xia,NA; NA; NA,2015 IEEE 21st International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS),,2015,,,388,395,"Distributed clouds, consisting of multiple data centers located at different geographical locations, provide a plethora of services to users. They however consume enormous amounts of electricity to power their data centers. The electricity bill is almost 30%-50% of their operational costs. Minimizing the electricity cost of distributed clouds thus is crucial to reduce the operational cost of their cloud service providers. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the electricity cost of a distributed cloud, by exploring the heterogeneities of cloud resources and user demands, and time-varying electricity prices, for which we first propose a two-stage optimization framework: dispatching user task requests to different data centers by incorporating the resource demands of the task requests, the workload, and the electricity price in each data center, and energy consumption profiles of different servers in each data center; followed by further energy optimization within each data center through consolidating Virtual Machines (VMs) to different servers to improve the resource utilization ratio. One critical constraint on such task dispatch and VM consolidation is to meet various user Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which include average task scheduling delays and resource demand violation limitations. Under the proposed framework, we then devise efficient scheduling algorithms for task dispatching and VM consolidations, while keeping both the average scheduling delay and resource demand violation limitation of each admitted task met. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations, using real data sets - the real electricity prices and task traces.

Power and cooling management and pricing of available resources are concerns of IaaS providers. The goal of an SaaS provider is to maximize the revenue from SLAs and minimize the cost of using IaaS resources. An IaaS provider wants to maximize the prices of its own resources that it charges its clients, and at the same time minimize the total power consumption of infrastructural resources.

However, due to heterogeneity of the resources, the performance difference exists generally.

We formulate the concept of discreteness for allocating VM for a request that needs k virtual machines. Each VM consists of several servers in multiple cabinets. The discreteness is measured to be the number of cabinets that k virtual machines span. We show that it is an NP-hard problem, and provide a heuristic election algorithm based maximum cost performance.

Live migration is applied into the dynamic consolidation, which allows VMs to be migrated to other hosts and aims to minimize the number of hosts in data centers.

However, resource scheduling and provisioning has become a milestone to handle such diverse issues related to cloud and get them under centralized control system. Workload prediction is an utmost requirement to dynamically predict the incoming workload and schedule the resources according to client needs. Dynamic workload prediction based on historical data can prove useful for pattern matching of current scenario with the past ones and allocate the resources in the most efficient way.

QoS-Driven Cloud Resource Management through Fuzzy Model Predictive Control,L. Wang; J. Xu; H. A. Duran-Limon; M. Zhao,NA; NA; NA; NA,2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing,,2015,,,81,90,"Virtualized systems such as public and private clouds are emerging as important new computing platforms with great potential to conveniently deliver computing across the Internet and efficiently utilize resources consolidated via virtualization. Resource management in virtualized systems remains a key challenge because of their intrinsically dynamic and complex nature, where the applications have dynamically changing workloads and virtual machines (VMs) compete for the shared resources in a convolved manner. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new resource management approach that can effectively capture the nonlinear behaviors in VM resource usages through fuzzy modeling and quickly adapt to the changes in the system through predictive control. The resulting fuzzy-model-predictive-control (FMPC) approach is capable of optimizing the VM resource allocations to applications according to their QoS targets. This approach is incorporated in a two-level cloud resource management framework where at the VM host level the node controllers employ FMPC to optimize dynamic VM resource allocations within individual hosts, and at the cloud zone level the global scheduler coordinates the node controllers to optimize resource utilization across hosts through dynamic VM migrations. The proposed approaches were implemented for Xen-based virtualized systems and evaluated using typical benchmarks (RUBiS, Free Bench) on a test bed with over 100 concurrent VMs. The results demonstrate that FMPC can accurately model the resource demands for dynamic applications and optimize the resource allocations to VMs with complex contentions. It substantially outperforms the traditional linear modeling based predictive control approach. The two-level resource management can make effective use of VM migrations to further improve performance across hosts as the host-level loads vary over time.",,978-1-4673-6971-8978-1-4673-6970,10.1109/ICAC.2015.41,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7266937,QoS;cloud computing;resource management,Predictive models;Resource management;Sensors;Manganese;Predictive control;Quality of service;Conferences,cloud computing;quality of service,QoS-driven cloud resource management;fuzzy model predictive control;virtual machines;fuzzy modeling;FMPC approach;QoS targets;dynamic VM migrations;Xen-based virtualized systems,,7,,29,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

While interoperability issues across different cloud platforms in a cloud federation have been extensively studied, fundamental questions on cloud economics remain: When and how should a cloud trade resources (e.g., virtual machines) with others, such that its net profit is maximized over the long run, while a close-to-optimal social welfare in the entire federation can also be guaranteed? To answer this question, a number of important, interrelated decisions, including job scheduling, server provisioning, and resource pricing, should be dynamically and jointly made, while the long-term profit optimality is pursued. In this work, we design efficient algorithms for intercloud virtual machine (VM) trading and scheduling in a cloud federation. For VM transactions among clouds, we design a double-auction-based mechanism that is strategy-proof, individual-rational, ex-post budget-balanced, and efficient to execute over time. Closely combined with the auction mechanism is a dynamic VM trading and scheduling algorithm, which carefully decides the true valuations of VMs in the auction, optimally schedules stochastic job arrivals with different service level agreements (SLAs) onto the VMs, and judiciously turns on and off servers based on the current electricity prices. Through rigorous analysis, we show that each individual cloud, by carrying out the dynamic algorithm in the online double auction, can achieve a time-averaged profit arbitrarily close to the offline optimum. Asymptotic optimality in social welfare is also achieved under homogeneous cloud settings. We carry out simulations to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms, and examine the achievable social welfare under heterogeneous cloud settings, as driven by the real-world Google cluster usage traces.",1063-6692;1558-2566,,10.1109/TNET.2015.2435015,Hong Kong RGC; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7124534,Double auction;federated cloud;individual profit;social welfare;stochastic optimization;virtual machine trading,Servers;Heuristic algorithms;Cloud computing;Pricing;Delays;Dynamic scheduling;Virtual machining,cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines,virtual machine trading;cloud federation;individual profit;social welfare maximization;resource sharing;resource availability;cloud economics;close-to-optimal social welfare;job scheduling;server provisioning;resource pricing;VM trading;VM transactions;double-auction-based mechanism;VM scheduling algorithm;service level agreement;SLA;Google cluster usage traces;heterogeneous cloud settings,,8,,26,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines
Energy-Efficient and SLA-Aware Virtual Machine Selection Algorithm for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Cloud Data Centers,S. Mashhadi Moghaddam; S. Fotuhi Piraghaj; M. O’Sullivan; C. Walker; C. Unsworth,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2018 IEEE/ACM 11th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC),,2018,,,103,113,"Energy consumption constitutes a significant proportion of data centers' operational costs. Furthermore, the establishment of large scale Cloud data centers due to the fast growth of utility-based IT services made the energy usage of data centers a concern. Cloud data centers use load balancing algorithms to allocate their physical resources (CPU, memory, hard disk, network bandwidth) efficiently on demand and hence optimize their energy consumption. In the load balancing process, some Virtual Machines (VMs) are selected from over-or under-utilized physical hosts and these VMs are migrated, while live and running, to other hosts. This live migration can result in Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and consequently low Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, in this paper, we propose an energy aware VM selection policy to minimize the number of migrations and consequently decrease SLAVs. Load balancing has three stages: a) Detecting over-and under-utilized hosts; b) Selecting one or more VMs for migration from those hosts; c) Finding destination hosts for the selected VMs. The focus of this research is on the VM selection stage of CPU load balancing. Our proposed VM selection algorithm considers CPU utilization of the VMs on each host and any linear correlation between the CPU usage of the VMs. The algorithm was evaluated on two different real Cloud data sets provided by the CoMon project and Google. Its performance was compared to our benchmark policy that only considers minimum migration time for VM selection. The results showed that our proposed algorithm decreases SLAVs by 66%, ESV (SLAVs × energy consumption) by 64% and the number of ""re over-utilized"" hosts by 81% when the CPU usage of VMs in a data set are highly correlated (e.g., as in the Google data set).",,978-1-5386-5504-7978-1-5386-5505,10.1109/UCC.2018.00019,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8603157,Cloud Computing;Virtual Machine;Load Balancing,Energy consumption;Correlation;Google;Load management;Data centers;Task analysis;Cloud computing,,,,,,27,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In the MapReduce enabled computing clouds, MapReduce jobs are carried out by homogeneous MapReduce VM instances that have identical hardware resource. Two resource allocation schemes with corresponding SLA constraints for the MapReduce VMs and the non-MapReduce VMs are proposed.

In this paradigm, data centers' operational energy costs are a rising concern as they continue an upward trend that is poised to surpass the capital cost of equipment in a typical lifetime usage model. A data center is a complex distributed system comprised of a hierarchy of numerous components; and operating at multitude levels of usage abstractions. Virtualization is an approach to consolidating multiple services onto a smaller number of computing resources. A virtualized server environment allows computing resources to be shared among multiple performance-isolated platforms called virtual machines.

In our approach, the computation resources of the data center are effectively organized into a hypercube structure. The hypercube seamlessly scales up and down as resources are either added or removed in response to changes in the number of provisioned VM instances. Without supervision from any central components, each compute node operates autonomously and manages its own workload by applying a set of distributed load balancing rules and algorithms. On one hand, underutilized nodes attempt to shift their workload to their hypercube neighbors and switch off.

Within the elasticity zone, performance evaluation between Type-I virtualized and non-virtualized DC is carried out.

Application-Aware Resource Allocation for SDN-based Cloud Datacenters,W. Hong; K. Wang; Y. Hsu,NA; NA; NA,2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data,,2013,,,106,110,"In cloud datacenters, since resource requirements change frequently, how to assign and manage resources efficiently while meeting service level agreements (SLAs) of different types of applications is an important research issue. In this paper, we propose an Application-aware Resource Allocation (App-RA) scheme to predict resource requirements and allocate an appropriate number of virtual machines (VMs) for each application in SDN-based cloud datacenters. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed App-RA is the first application-aware resource allocation scheme that adapts to all types of applications. The App-RA can meet SLAs, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce power consumption for each application in cloud datacenters. The proposed App-RA adopts the neural network based predictor to forecast the requirements of resources (CPU, Memory, GPU, Disk I/O and bandwidth) for an application. In the proposed App-RA, we have designed two algorithms which allocate appropriate numbers of virtual machines and use the VM allocation threshold to avoid SLA violations for five different types of applications. In addition, we adopt an SDN-based OpenFlow network with CICQ switches to appropriately schedule packets for different types of application in the network layer. Finally, simulation results show that the power consumption of the proposed App-RA is only 9.21% higher than that of the best case (oracle) and the power consumption of EAACVA, which is a representative resource allocation method for non-graphic applications, is 104.58% worse than that of App-RA.

Existing research has demonstrated several algorithms that can be used to determine the optimal number of resources required to service these requests. However, a key issue not addressed in these algorithms is determining the frequency of recalculating the number of required resources. Changing the required resources at a rate slower than the optimal update frequency results in lower energy efficiency due to the over allocation of resources. Changing the resources at a rate higher than the optimal frequency results in insufficient time for systems to change state, which results in SLA violations.

Partial Utility-Driven Scheduling for Flexible SLA and Pricing Arbitration in Clouds,J. Simão; L.

This is too inflexible because consumers lose non-measurable amounts of performance being only compensated later, in next charging cycles. We propose to schedule virtual machines (VMs), driven by range-based non-linear reductions of utility, different for classes of users and across different ranges of resource allocations: partial utility. This customer-defined metric, allows providers transferring resources between VMs in meaningful and economically efficient ways. We define a comprehensive cost model incorporating partial utility given by clients to a certain level of degradation, when VMs are allocated in overcommitted environments (Public, Private, Community Clouds). CloudSim was extended to support our scheduling model. Several simulation scenarios with synthetic and real workloads are presented, using datacenters with different dimensions regarding the number of servers and computational capacity. We show the partial utility-driven driven scheduling allows more VMs to be allocated. It brings benefits to providers, regarding revenue and resource utilization, allowing for more revenue per resource allocated and scaling well with the size of datacenters when comparing with an utility-oblivious redistribution of resources.

While it provides many advanced features, there are still some shortcomings, such as the exorbitant operational cost. It is indeed at the center of several fields of research.

The management of energy consumption in the world of Cloud is the one on which we concentrated through this paper, that is part of a work around the energetic aspect of Cloud Computing. The field of Green Computing is becoming more and more important in a world of limited energy resources and a growing demand for greater computing power, it therefore represents one of the major concerns, that we are dealing with in this paper, in order to optimize the consumption of electrical energy in a virtualized Cloud Platform, while respecting the requirements of SLAs. We propose a framework which offers effective improvements in a scalable Cloud architecture. A solution is to dynamically consolidate the Virtual Machines (VMs in the paper) of the platform in a lower number of nodes (hosts), during the time of low load situations, in order to shutdown unsolicited nodes, in the condition of providing an acceptable level of availability and response time and storage capacity so as not to penalize the user and respect the constraints of the service contracts.",2161-5330;2161-5322,978-1-4799-7100,10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073221,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073221,Cloud Computing;Green Computing;Virtualization;Power consumption;VMs consolidation;Live migration,Servers;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Resource management;Virtual machining;Computer architecture,cloud computing;contracts;green computing;power aware computing;scheduling;software architecture;virtual machines;virtualisation,power-aware virtual machine consolidation architecture;VM;CPU load scheduling;cloud computing;energy consumption management;green computing;cloud platform virtualization;SLA;service level agreement;service contract constraint,,,,16,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

One major problem for Cloud providers is the trade-off between the huge amount of energy consumption resulting from the non optimal utilisation of their servers, and meeting the service level agreements. Virtualisation allows for a better utilisation of existing servers while maintaining the required quality of service, increasing the return on investment. Consequently, dynamic algorithms are needed that determine an optimal plan for the live migration and allocation of Virtual Machines (VM) during run time. The contribution of this paper is as follows: First, we present our forecast module for time series to future utilisation of VMs. Second, we demonstrate how forecasts of CPU utilisation can be used beneficially in Cloud Computing environments. We propose a novel proactive VM migration policy utilising forecasts(PRUF) in Cloud data centres using an predictive overload detection. It uses short-term VM utilisation forecasts based on an ensemble forecasting approach to estimate which host will be overloaded when the next migration process is triggered.

The main difference between the two models is the energy and time required to put the server in operational mode from a sleep mode or from an off state. Therefore, the decision is a tradeoff between the energy savings and the required performance according to the SLA between the client and the cloud provider.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a Peak Load Scheduling Control (PLSC) method to promote the Quality of Service (QoS) of peak loads for modern energy-efficient datacenters. However, peak loads are usually difficult to identify. To overcome this difficulty, PLSC tracks the number of requests residing in a VM by leveraging a two-tier request queue maintained by it. When the number exceeds the capability of the VM, it means that peak loads appear. In this case, PLSC adds some delay-tolerant requests to the secondary queue. The scheduling of requests in the secondary queue is controlled with a lower priority than that of requests in the primary queue. Sequentially, with critical requests maintained in the primary queue, PLSC shortens the response time of critical requests. In addition, PLSC expands the number of QoS-guaranteed requests. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to attest the effectiveness of PLSC, by simulating a typical energy-efficient datacenter. The experimental results show that PLSC significantly promotes the QoS of workloads with a negligible impact on energy saving.",2168-7161;2372-0018,,10.1109/TCC.2018.2886187,Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou; Science and Technology Planning Project of Nansha; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8573845,workload burst;performance promotion;QoS guarantee;dynamic power management;data center,Quality of service;Servers;Hardware;Energy consumption;Schedules;Cloud computing;Dynamic scheduling,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

A cloud is an aggregation of resources or services that are provided as service through network. In earlier version of cloud computing (grid computing) it was enough to find the subset of resources for the applications whereas cloud computing goes one step higher allocating resources to Virtual Machines (VM's) as well as scheduling tasks on the VM's. So resource scheduling is indispensable in cloud computing for load balancing and maximizing the utilization while minimizing the execution time and energy.

Virtual machine scheduling for multicores considering effects of shared on-chip last level cache interference,Shin-gyu Kim; H. Eom; H. Y.

One reason for these problems is the use of server consolidation policy based on virtualization technologies for maximizing the efficiency of resource usage. Because current virtualization technologies do not ensure performance isolation among active virtual machines (VMs), it is required to consider resource usage pattern of VMs to improve total throughput and quality of service. In this paper, we propose a virtual machine scheduler for multicore processors, which exploits the last-level cache (LLC) reference ratio.

How to efficiently place virtual machines so that the cost can be saved as much as possible, while guaranteeing the quality of service plays a critical role in enhancing the competitiveness of service cloud provider. Considering the heterogeneous servers and the random property of multiple resources requirements of virtual machines, the problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear programming in this paper. Virtual machine cluster with higher traffic is made staying together. This reduces the communication delay while saving the inter-server bandwidth consumption, especially the relatively scarce higher level bandwidth, by exploiting the topology information of data center. At the same time, statistic multiplex and newly defined “similarity” techniques are leveraged to consolidate virtual machines. The violation of resource capacity is kept at any designated minimal probability. Thus the quality of service will not be deteriorated while saving servers and network cost.

The problem of allocation virtual machines to physical hosts is one of the most important challenges of infrastructure as a service layer in the cloud computing environment and energy consumption can be optimized by minimizing the number of switched on physical hosts. In general, the problem of optimal allocation of virtual machines to physical hosts can be divided into three sub-problems. The first problem asks when should the virtual machine migrate?. The second issue deals with which virtual machine should migrate?. The third issue should response to the question that where should the virtual machine migrate?. The main focus of this study is to solve the third problem. In this paper, a method based on the imperialist competitive algorithm is provided for optimal allocation of virtual machines to physical hosts.

To avoid such SLA violations and to maintain a low energy consumption, this work proposes a heuristics-based VM allocation mechanism. Under the proposed mechanism, VMs showing high CPU utilization correlations to other co-located peers and hosts with extreme utilization values are both assigned with high heuristic values. VMs with high heuristic values are therefore less preferred to be co-located onto a host that has a high heuristic value.

Cloud and Multi-cloud Computing: Current Challenges and Future Applications,D. Ardagna,NA,2015 IEEE/ACM 7th International Workshop on Principles of Engineering Service-Oriented and Cloud Systems,,2015,,,1,2,"Computing systems are becoming increasingly virtual. We come from a world where applications were entirely developed by organizations for their own use, possibly exploiting components and/or platforms developed by third parties, but mainly deployed and executed on the organizations own IT facilities. With Service Oriented systems, we moved into a world in which a software application may delegate part of its functionality to already existing software services run by external organizations. Recent advances in Cloud computing are pushing virtuality even further: users can access third party software components, hardware physical resources or full application stacks that support execution and automatic management of Cloud based applications, and pay only for the resources they use. Cloud computing is growing daily, providing a vibrant technical environment where innovative solutions and services can be created. The Cloud promises the capability for cheap and flexible services for end-users and allows small organizations and individuals to host and offer world-scale services, themselves. However, while there has been substantial research in the field already, there still remain open challenges. Specifically, Cloud business models and technologies introduce critical issues, such as proprietary APIs and lack of interoperability [1]. The choice of the application architecture matching and fully exploiting the characteristics of the underlying Cloud environments is also critical [2], [3]. At the infrastructural layer, resource contentions lead to unpredictable performance [4] and additional work for resource management [5], automated VM and service migration [6] is still needed. Also networks are frequently the Cloud bottleneck and data center energy management is very critical [7]. To cope with such challenges the adoption of multi-Clouds [8], has been advocated by many researchers, since deploying software on multiple Clouds overcomes single provider unavailability and allows to build cost efficient follow the sun applications. Moreover, Cloud computing is also becoming a mainstream solution to provide very large clusters in a pay per use basis to support Big data applications [9]. Many cloud providers already include in their offering MapReduce based platforms (i.e., one of the most adopted framework to support large volume unstructured information processing) such as Google MapReduce framework, Microsoft HDinsight, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. IDC estimates that by 2020, nearly 40% of Big Data analyses will be supported by public cloud. To support such challenges a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach developed within the MODAClouds (www. modaclouds.eu) and DICE (dice-h2020.eu) European projects will be presented. MDD allows shifting the paradigm from code-centric to model-centric. Models are thus the main artefacts of the development process and enable developers to work at a high level of abstraction by focusing on Cloud concerns rather than implementation details [10]. Model transformations help automating the work of going from abstract concepts to implementation. Moreover, models can also be used to reason about the QoS properties of an application [2] and to support design-time exploration in order to identify the Cloud deployment configuration of minimum cost, while satisfying QoS constraints [3]. Finally, models can be kept alive also at runtime to trigger dynamic adaptation [10], [5], providing QoS guarantees even under workload fluctuations, virtualized systems performance degradations, or failures.",2156-793X;2156-7921,978-1-4673-7058,10.1109/PESOS.2015.8,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7172841,Cloud computing;Model Driven Development;Quality of Service;Application portability,Cloud computing;Conferences;Organizations;Resource management;Quality of service;Big data,cloud computing;service-oriented architecture,multicloud computing;computing systems;service oriented systems;software application;software services;external organizations;software components;cloud business models;interoperability;cloud environments;infrastructural layer;resource contentions;resource management;data center energy management;cloud bottleneck;big data applications;model-driven development;MDD approach;QoS properties;cloud deployment configuration;workload fluctuations,,8,,10,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In contrast to the existing works that assume resource demands of virtual machines are given as scalar variables, this paper treats these demands as random variables with known means and standard deviations because the demands are not deterministic in many situations. These random variables may be correlated with one another, and there are several types of resources which can be performance bottlenecks. Therefore, both correlations and resource type heterogeneity must be considered. The virtual machine consolidation problem is thus formulated as a multi-capacity stochastic bin packing problem.

Today, information and communication technology (ICT) has become a major consumer of energy worldwide. A large portion of ICT energy consumption is used to power servers running in DCs and the network they use to communicate. In this paper, we consider that energy cost at a particular DC is often related to the electricity price regulated by independent system operators/regional transmission organizations. As these prices vary in time and depend on the geographical locations of the DCs, recent studies have shown that the spatio-temporal variations of electricity price can be exploited to reduce electricity cost. In particular, as workloads tend to change, often unpredictably, adaptive workload placement and migration can help to serve the workloads in regions with lower electricity costs. While most prior works consider a quasi-static scenario with known workload patterns, this paper proposes dynamic workload-aware algorithms which exploit the spatio-temporal variations of electricity costs to minimize the energy cost in ICT. Although prior studies focused on power consumption from power consumers such as servers, cooling systems, etc., recent studies have shown that the network elements consume a significant portion of the energy. Hence, while reducing DC energy cost, this paper also considers electricity cost of the backbone network. Algorithms introduced in this paper use dynamic request re-routing and live virtual machine (VM) migration to move workloads to DCs with lower electricity cost. We consider VM migration cost (including electricity cost at backbone network nodes), bandwidth constraints for migration, VM consolidation, constraints from service level agreement, and administrative overhead of VM migration. Our simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms reduce operational cost of DCs significantly.",2473-2400,,10.1109/TGCN.2017.2780133,NSF; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8166762,Data centers;dynamic workload;power consumption model;VM migration;cost savings,Power demand;Servers;Heuristic algorithms;Energy consumption;Load modeling;Minimization;Cloud computing,,,,1,,21,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Virtual Machine Consolidation with Multiple Usage Prediction for Energy-Efficient Cloud Data Centers,T. H. Nguyen; M. Di Francesco; A.

In this context, most of the existing solutions rely on aggressive virtual machine migration, thus resulting in unnecessary overhead and energy wastage. Besides, virtual machine consolidation should take into account multiple resource types at the same time, since CPU is not the only critical resource in cloud data centers. In fact, also memory and network bandwidth can become a bottleneck, possibly causing violations in the service level agreement. This article presents a virtual machine consolidation algorithm with multiple usage prediction (VMCUP-M) to improve the energy efficiency of cloud data centers. In this context, multiple usage refers to both resource types and the horizon employed to predict future utilization. Our algorithm is executed during the virtual machine consolidation process to estimate the long-term utilization of multiple resource types based on the local history of the considered servers. The joint use of current and predicted resource utilization allows for a reliable characterization of overloaded and underloaded servers, thereby reducing both the load and the power consumption after consolidation. We evaluate our solution through simulations on both synthetic and real-world workloads.

GLAP: Distributed Dynamic Workload Consolidation through Gossip-Based Learning,M. Khelghatdoust; V. Gramoli; D. Sun,NA; NA; NA,2016 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER),,2016,,,80,89,"Dynamic virtual machine consolidation (DVMC) using live migration is one of the most promising solutions to reduce energy consumption in cloud data centers. Distributed DVMC often aggressively consolidates virtual machines (VMs) at the high expense of Service Level Agreement (SLA) of customers due to virtual machines (VMs) workload fluctuations. To alleviate this, static and adaptive threshold algorithms were proposed. However, the former is unable to predict the VMs future resource demands and the latter calculates a fixed threshold value for all physical machines (PMs) while each PM hosts VMs with different workload patterns. Moreover, both methods cannot consolidate VMs to maintain PMs in a long-term safe state. To overcome these problems, we propose a fully distributed and threshold-free DVMC algorithm called, GLAP. We combine Q-Learning with a gossip-based protocol to characterize workload patterns of VMs and take consolidation decisions. We also propose a novel two-phase distributed algorithm by which PMs unify the learned pattern which is vital for efficient execution of the algorithm. Finally, we compare GLAP experimentally against three existing techniques and show that GLAP reduces by from 43% to 78% the number of overloaded PMs under the Google Cluster VMs workload traces.",2168-9253,978-1-5090-3653-0978-1-5090-3654,10.1109/CLUSTER.2016.24,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776481,,Protocols;Resource management;Heuristic algorithms;Virtual machining;Switches;Prediction algorithms;Monitoring,cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;distributed algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power aware computing;virtual machines,distributed dynamic workload consolidation;gossip-based learning;dynamic virtual machine consolidation;live migration;energy consumption reduction;cloud data centers;distributed DVMC;virtual machines;service level agreement;SLA;VM workload fluctuations;adaptive threshold algorithms;static threshold algorithms;resource demands;physical machines;workload patterns;fully distributed DVMC algorithm;threshold-free DVMC algorithm;GLAP;Q-Learning;gossip-based protocol;two-phase distributed algorithm;Google Cluster VM workload traces;gossip learning resource allocation protocol,,1,,23,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, maximizing energy efficiency and utilization of cloud datacenter resources, avoiding undesired thermal hotspots (due to overheating of over-utilized computing equipment), and ensuring quality of service guarantees for HPC applications are all conflicting objectives, which require joint consideration of multiple pairwise tradeoffs. The novel concept of heat imbalance, which captures the unevenness in heat generation and extraction, at different regions inside a HPC cloud datacenter is introduced.

The algorithm is implemented on simulation platform CloudSim, and experiments show that it can improve the load balance of cloud data center and decrease total power consumption effectively, thus having a certain guiding significance for researching the virtual machine placement policy.",,978-1-5386-3790-6978-1-5386-3791,10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00135,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367365,Cloud Datacenter;Placement Policy;Load Balance;Power Consumption;MOGA,Power demand;Virtual machining;Data centers;Cloud computing;Heuristic algorithms;Encoding;Genetic algorithms,cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;genetic algorithms;power aware computing;power consumption;resource allocation;virtual machines,dynamic placement policy;cloud environment;load imbalance;virtual machine placement policy;live migration techniques;target host selection algorithm;MOGA-THSA;heuristic algorithm;load balance;total power consumption;cloud data centers;genetic operators;SLA violation rate,,,,13,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
SMPA: An Energy-Aware Service Migration Strategy in Cloud Networks,B. Yu; Y. Han; X. Wen; Z. Xu,NA; NA; NA; NA,2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD),,2016,,,984,989,"Cloud computing has become a promising paradigm in the field of Services Computing for its advantage of providing infrastructures and resources as a service. However, cloud networks consume huge amount of energy consumption due to the various applications and large scale of users with high mobility. In this paper, we investigate the problem of service migration to minimize the energy consumption of cloud infrastructures while ensuring the service delivery with satisfied latency and economic cost. We propose an energy-efficient migration scheme named SMPA considering the economic aspects and the quality of service. Furthermore, the mechanism of virtual machine consolidation running different services is also designed in SMPA, when the requests arrive, change or depart. Extensive simulations conducted on random topologies show that our proposal reduces requests' SLA violation ratio and improves the utilization of provider resources by service migration.

Dynamic Tuning for Parameter-Based Virtual Machine Placement,A. Mosa; R. Sakellariou,NA; NA,2018 17th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC),,2018,,,38,45,"Virtual machine (VM) placement is the process that allocates virtual machines onto physical machines (PMs) in cloud data centers. Reservation-based VM placement allocates VMs to PMs according to a (statically) reserved VM size regardless of the actual workload. If, at some point in time, a VM is making use of only a fraction of its reservation this leads to PM underutilization, which wastes energy and, at a grand scale, it may result in financial and environmental costs. In contrast, demand-based VM placement consolidates VMs based on the actual workload's demand. This may lead to better utilization, but it may incur a higher number of Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) resulting from overloaded PMs and/or VM migrations from one PM to another as a result of workload fluctuations. To control the tradeoff between utilization and the number of SLAVs, parameter-based VM placement can allow a provider, through a single parameter, to explore the whole space of VM placement options that range from demand-based to reservation-based. The idea investigated by this paper is to adjust this parameter continuously at run-time in a way that a provider can maintain the number of SLAVs below a certain (predetermined) threshold while using the smallest possible number of PMs for VM placement. Two dynamic algorithms to select a value of this parameter on-the-fly are proposed.

Nevertheless, energy efficiency is not worth the effort if quality metrics (e.g., QoS, QoE) are severely decreased by, e.g., dynamic consolidation using live migration. We identify the most significant utilization metrics to predict the service level during live migrations for a web server scenario. We show important correlations, give reasons and draw conclusions for systems using live migration for yielding higher energy efficiency. We also give reasons for extending the current hypervisors' capabilities regarding VM utilization collection and reporting. We present the effects of live migration on service levels for different workload scenarios. In particular, we demonstrate that live migration should be done preventively.

Virtual Machine Proactive Scaling in Cloud Systems,A. Sallam; K. Li,NA; NA,2012 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing Workshops,,2012,,,97,105,"Although the investment in Cloud Computing incredibly grows in the last few years, the offered technologies for dynamic scaling in Cloud Systems don't satisfy neither nowadays fluky applications (i.e. social networks, web hosting, content delivery) that exploit the power of the Cloud, nor the energy challenges caused by its data-centers. In this work we propose a proactive model based on an application behaviors prediction technique to predict the future workload behavior of the virtual machines (VMs) executed at Cloud hosts. The predicted information can help VMs to dynamically and proactively be adapted to satisfy the provider demands in terms of increasing the utilization and decreasing the power consumption, and to enhance the services in terms of improving the performance with respect to the Quality of Services (QoS) requirements and dynamic changes demands.

Job Classification in Cloud Computing: The Classification Effects on Energy Efficiency,A. Aldulaimy; R. Zantout; A. Zekri; W. Itani,NA; NA; NA; NA,2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC),,2015,,,547,552,"One of the recent and major challenges in cloud computing is to enhance the energy efficiency in cloud data centers. Such enhancements can be done by improving the resource allocation and management algorithms. In this paper, a model that identifies common patterns for the jobs submitted to the cloud is proposed. This model is able to predict the type of the job submitted, and accordingly, the set of users' jobs is classified into four subsets. Each subset contains jobs that have similar requirements. In addition to the jobs' common pattern and requirements, the users' history is considered in the jobs' type prediction model. The goal of job classification is to find a way to propose useful strategy that helps improve energy efficiency. Following the process of jobs' classification, the best fit virtual machine is allocated to each job. Then, the virtual machines are placed to the physical machines according to a novel strategy called Mixed Type Placement strategy. The core idea of the proposed strategy is to place virtual machines of the jobs of different types in the same physical machine whenever possible, based on Knapsack Problem. This is because different types of jobs do not intensively use the same compute or storage resources in the physical machine. This strategy reduces the number of active physical machines which leads to major reduction in the total energy consumption in the data center.

However, it is very difficult for IaaS cloud providers to guarantee both of energy saving and performance under the condition of satisfying SLA (Service Level Agreement).

Thus, a more energy-saving method with lower workloads is desired. In this paper, in order to adaptively discover optimal thresholds, we propose a novel workload prediction-based framework, which seamlessly integrates a feature-selection-based prediction method and a model of measuring the relationship between the energy cost of the migration of virtual machine (VM) and the power incomes when the physical machine (PM) shuts down. Furthermore, a threshold discovering algorithm is designed to dynamically capture reasonable thresholds effectively.

A fog node, utilizing the cloud technologies, can lease and release virtual machines (VMs) in an on-demand fashion. For the power-limited mobile IoT devices (e.g., wearable devices and smart phones), their quality of service (QoS) may be degraded owing to the varying wireless channel conditions. Power control helps maintain the wireless transmission rate and hence the QoS. The QoS (i.e., task completion time) is affected by both the fog processing and wireless transmission; it is thus important to jointly optimize fog resource provisioning (i.e., decisions on the number of VMs to rent) and power control.

Over-provisioning techniques are typically used for meeting the peak workloads. In this paper we present an autonomic power and performance management method for cloud systems in order to dynamically match the application requirements with ""just-enough"" system resources at runtime that lead to significant power reduction while meeting the quality of service requirements of the cloud applications. Our solution offers the following capabilities: 1) real-time monitoring of the cloud resources and workload behavior running on virtual machines (VMs), 2) determine the current operating point of both workloads and the VMs running these workloads, 3) characterize workload behavior and predict the next operating point for the VMs, 4) dynamically manage the VM resources (scaling up and down the number of cores, CPU frequency, and memory amount) at run time, and 5) assign available cloud resources that can guarantee optimal power consumption without sacrificing the QoS requirements of cloud workloads. We validate the performance of our approach using the RUBiS benchmark, an auction model emulating eBay transactions that generates a wide range of workloads (such as browsing and bidding with different number of clients).

To overcome this, Edge Cloud Computing can be utilized to execute tasks on behalf of the devices, allowing them to run applications that would normally be too demanding. In this service model, it is important to maintain a low Service Delay to keep the service transparent to the user. This can be achieved by focusing on lowering the Transmission Delay and Processing Delay. While existing approaches in the literature focus on one of those two, we postulate that only when considering both delays you can efficiently lower Service Delay and provide quality to all applications. In order to do that while being feasible, we propose a method based on Particle Swarm Optimization for lowering Service Delay in Edge Cloud Computing.

Physical machine (PM) provisioning is a key problem for IaaS cloud providers on their resource utilization and quality of service to users. Proper provisioning is able to ensure the service quality while conserving unnecessary power consumption from over-provisioned PMs. However, the effectiveness of PM provisioning in current IaaS providers such as Amazon and Rackspace is severely limited by that they offer virtual machines with proportional resource provisioning on different resource types (including CPU, memory and disk etc). Such a rigid offering cannot satisfy diversified user applications in the cloud, and can cause significant over-provision on PMs in order to satisfy users' requirement on all resource types. This paper argues a more flexible approach that IaaS providers should offer virtual machines with flexible combinations on multiple resource types. We further formulate the problem of multiple resource virtual machine allocations for IaaS clouds, and develop analytical models to predict the suitable number of PMs while satisfying a predefined quality-of-service requirement.

Live migration of multi-tier applications across geographically distributed data centers is important for load management, power saving, routine server maintenance and quality-of-service. Different from a single-VM migration, VMs in a multi-tier application are closely correlated, which results in a correlated VM migrations problem. Current live migration algorithms for single-VM cause significant application performance degradation because intermediate data exchange between different VMs suffers relatively low bandwidth and high latency across distributed data centers. In this paper, we design and implement a coordination system called VMbuddies for correlated VM migrations in the cloud.

Cloud computing has many challenges, among them, the specification of work platforms in a cloud environment. In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers.

Du,NA; NA; NA; NA,"2014 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Modelling, Analysis & Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems",,2014,,,81,90,In this paper we propose a flexible and scalable distributed storage framework called flex Store that can adapt to variations in available or consumable power and demonstrate its performance in the context of reduplicated virtual machine disks. We propose and investigate smart control techniques in order to cope with the power constraints either introduced as a result of increasing node density in the storage arrays (consumable power constraints) or introduced when a mix of renewable (green) and conventional (brown) energy sources are used to power the data enter. The key component in the proposed storage framework is the policy engine which is a software layer that provides interfaces to define performance requirements of the applications (and also energy related policies). The policy engine enforces those policies in the storage system by adjusting the allocation of storage resources. The experimental results demonstrate the ability of the framework to dynamically adapt to the changes in workload and power constraints and minimize performance impacts. Our evaluation of the prototype shows that the adaptive replication mechanisms can reduce the IO latencies by around 65% during energy plenty situations and the impact of adaptation actions on IO latencies during energy constrained situations is reduced by more than 40% compared to the case without the adaptive replication and optimized adaptation mechanisms.,1526-7539;2375-0227,978-1-4799-5610,10.1109/MASCOTS.2014.18,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033640,software defined storage;deduplication;energy adaptation;replication control,Synchronization;Engines;Bandwidth;Virtual machining;Software;Quality of service;Renewable energy sources,distributed processing;storage management,software defined energy adaptive distributed storage framework;FlexStore;virtual machine disks;smart control techniques;node density;policy engine;software layer;adaptive replication mechanisms,,1,,18,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The Optimized Reinforcement Learning Approach to Run-Time Scheduling in Data Center,W. Yan; C. Lin; S. Pang,NA; NA; NA,2010 Ninth International Conference on Grid and Cloud Computing,,2010,,,46,51,"Warehouse data center is very large scale and complex, which constains tens of thousands servers and accomodates various applications. What's more important, energy consumption has risen to a critical point. Scheduling needs to maintain performance and reduce energy consumption as much as possible. Previous researches have proposed RL (reinforcement learning) as a solution. These approaches have reduced energy consumption in IT equipment to the extent of “improved operation” while maintain SLA (Service Level Agreement) and throughput. However, with consideration of the special condition of data center, more optimization of RL could be discovered. We find through careful optimization of RL, we could save much more energy in IT equipment (about 12%) while maintain performance. When we consider 110 billion kWh/year energy consumption in 2011, 12% saving of energy in IT equipment would make a dramatic difference in operation cost or even feasibility. Our approach sets up ideal state which would maintain performance and reduce energy consumption. When some machines deviate from that ideal state, the schedulers in the data center compute the gains and costs of VM migrations to determine whether operations such as consolidation or ban lancing would be carried. In this way, we apply long range value estimation, exploration elimination, combining of planning and learning to optimize RL. The simulation of real internet workload trace shows our design saves much more energy in IT equipment and maintains performance with much less VM migration.",2160-4908;2160-4916,978-1-4244-9334-0978-0-7695-4313,10.1109/GCC.2010.22,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662530,Data center scheduling;Reinforcement learning,Servers;Mathematical model;Throughput;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Prediction algorithms,computer centres;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);scheduling;virtual machines,reinforcement learning;runtime scheduling;warehouse data center;energy consumption;IT equipment;service level agreement;virtual machine migrations;Internet workload trace,,,,23,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The challenge for the cloud is to minimize the task execution and data transfer time to the user, whose location changes due to mobility. However, providing quality of service guarantees is particularly challenging in the dynamic MCC environment, due to the time-varying bandwidth of the access links, the ever changing available processing capacity at each server and the timevarying data volume of each virtual machine. In this article, we advocate the need for novel cloud architectures and migration mechanisms that effectively bring the computing power of the cloud closer to the mobile user.

Meanwhile, green computing has become a major concern for the Cloud designers and administrators. However, previous energy aware scheduling algorithms in Clouds mainly emphasize on the energy saving based on the system workload with few considerations on the allocation of real-time tasks. To address this issue, in this study, we focus on energy-aware scheduling for real-time tasks in Clouds and propose a novel scheduling algorithm ERES. The ERES integrates the elasticity of Clouds into real-time task scheduling, i.e., ERES strives to reduce the energy consumption of system while guaranteeing the QoS of real-time tasks. If some real-time tasks cannot be finished before their deadlines on current active resources, it dynamically adds new virtual machines (VMs) to enhance the Cloud processing capability although more energy will be consumed. Conversely, when monitoring that some VMs are idle for a period, these VMs will be deleted and other VMs will be consolidated dynamically for energy saving. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our ERES.

In this paper, we propose a new soft real-time scheduling algorithm that employs flexible priority designations (via utility functions) and automated scheduler class detection (via hypervisor monitoring of user behavior) to provide a higher quality user experience. We have implemented our scheduler within the Xen virtualization platform, and demonstrate that the overheads incurred from co-locating large numbers of virtual machines can be reduced from 66% with existing schedulers to under 2% in our system. We evaluate the benefits and overheads of using a smaller scheduling time quantum in a VDI setting, and show that the average overhead time per scheduler call is on the same order as the existing SEDF and Credit schedulers.",1548-615X;1548-615X;1548-615X,978-1-4673-1298-1978-1-4673-1296-7978-1-4673-1297,10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245988,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245988,Xen;scheduler;virtual desktop infrastructure;desktop virtualization;cloud computing,Scheduling algorithms;Virtual machine monitors;Scheduling;Quality of service;Virtual machining;Delay;Protocols,cache storage;cloud computing;microcomputers;office environment;scheduling;virtual enterprises;virtual machines;virtualisation,adaptive dynamic priority scheduling;virtual desktop infrastructures;cloud computing;office environments;virtualized setting;physical desktop machines;VDI environment;IT management expenses;available-anywhere desktops;virtualized I/O;CPU scheduling interference problems;shared-cache contention;soft real-time scheduling algorithm;flexible priority designations;utility functions;automated scheduler class detection;hypervisor monitoring;user behavior;quality user experience;Xen virtualization platform;virtual machines;scheduling time quantum;VDI setting;SEDF;credit schedulers,,19,,15,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Robust Server Consolidation: Coping with Peak Demand Underestimation,D. Grimes; D. Mehta; B. O’Sullivan; R. Birke; L. Chen; T. Scherer; I. Castineiras,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"2016 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)",,2016,,,271,276,"Energy consumption in data centres accounts for a significant proportion of national energy usage in many countries. One approach for reducing energy consumption is to improve the server usage efficiency via workload consolidation. However, there are two primary reasons why this is not done to a large extent. The first reason is that greater consolidation could result in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) if resources are over-utilised. The second reason is that users specify the requirements of a virtual machine (VM) based on the maximum estimated usage for each resource over the whole life span of the VM, and usually over-estimate these maximum values to avoid possible contract violations. Typically, the VM will have significantly lower resource usage in most time periods. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed to predict resource usage of VMs. We show that although these prediction techniques are efficient when their performances are measured using well known metrics, a low prediction error can still result in significant violations of SLAs if not handled properly during workload allocation. Our results emphasise the importance of analysing workload prediction in conjunction with workload allocation techniques. We examine the impact of using predicted resource usage for optimal server consolidation. We investigate the occurrences of over-utilised resources on servers due to under-predicted resource usage. We propose methods to reduce the likelihood of such occurrences, both through the enforcement of safety capacities on the server side, and through biasing towards over-prediction on the VM side. The results indicate that an appropriate balance can be found between energy savings and non-violation of SLAs.",2375-0227,978-1-5090-3432-1978-1-5090-3433,10.1109/MASCOTS.2016.60,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774589,,Servers;Virtual machining;Resource management;Training;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Neural networks,computer centres;power aware computing;resource allocation;virtual machines,robust server consolidation;peak demand underestimation;energy consumption;data centres;national energy usage;server usage efficiency;service level agreements;SLA;virtual machine;VM;resource usage;energy savings,,1,,9,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Applications of different performance targets often exhibit different resource demands. Thus, it is not trivial to translate individual application SLOs to corresponding resource shares in a shared virtualized environment to meet performance targets. In this paper, we present CtrlCloud, a performance-aware resource controlling system, that adaptively allocates resources, with a resource-share controller and an allocation optimization model. The controller automatically adapts resource demands based on performance deviations, while the optimization model resolves conflicts in resource demands from multiple co-located applications based on their ongoing performance achieved. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of CtrlCloud in Python on top of Xen hypervisor. Our experimental results indicate that CtrlCloud can optimize allocations of CPU resources across multiple applications to maintain the 95th percentile latency within predefined SLO targets. CtrlCloud also provides QoS differentiation and yet fulfilling of CPU share demands from applications is maximized given resource availability.

While extensive studies exist on enabling interoperability across different cloud platforms, a fundamental question on cloud economics remains unanswered: When and how should a cloud trade VMs with others, such that its net profit is maximized over the long run? In order to answer this question by the federation, a number of important, correlated decisions, including job scheduling, server provisioning and resource pricing, need to be dynamically made, with long-term profit optimality being a goal. In this work, we design efficient algorithms for inter-cloud resource trading and scheduling in a federation of geo-distributed clouds. For VM trading among clouds, we apply a double auction-based mechanism that is strategy proof, individual rational, and ex-post budget balanced.

Optimizing Resource Consumptions in Clouds,L. He; D. Zou; Z. Zhang; K. Yang; H. Jin; S. A. Jarvis,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing,,2011,,,42,49,"This paper considers the scenario where multiple clusters of Virtual Machines (i.e., termed as Virtual Clusters) are hosted in a Cloud system consisting of a cluster of physical nodes. Multiple Virtual Clusters (VCs) cohabit in the physical cluster, with each VC offering a particular type of service for the incoming requests. In this context, VM consolidation, which strives to use a minimal number of nodes to accommodate all VMs in the system, plays an important role in saving resource consumption. Most existing consolidation methods proposed in the literature regard VMs as ""rigid"" during consolidation, i.e., VMs' resource capacities remain unchanged. In VC environments, QoS is usually delivered by a VC as a single entity. Therefore, there is no reason why VMs' resource capacity cannot be adjusted as long as the whole VC is still able to maintain the desired QoS. Treating VMs as being ""mouldable"" during consolidation may be able to further consolidate VMs into an even fewer number of nodes. This paper investigates this issue and develops a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to consolidate mouldable VMs. The GA is able to evolve an optimized system state, which represents the VM-to-node mapping and the resource capacity allocated to each VM. After the new system state is calculated by the GA, the Cloud will transit from the current system state to the new one. The transition time represents overhead and should be minimized. In this paper, a cost model is formalized to capture the transition overhead, and a reconfiguration algorithm is developed to transit the Cloud to the optimized system state at the low transition overhead. Experiments have been conducted in this paper to evaluate the performance of the GA and the reconfiguration algorithm.",2152-1093;2152-1085,978-0-7695-4572-1978-1-4577-1904,10.1109/Grid.2011.15,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076497,virtualization;Cluster;Cloud,Genetic algorithms;Quality of service;Resource management;Entropy;Servers;Cloud computing,cloud computing;genetic algorithms;quality of service;resource allocation;virtual machines,resource consumptions optimization;cloud computing;virtual machines;virtual clusters;QoS;genetic algorithm,,8,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Cloud-based service brings benefits in cost, energy efficiency, sharing of resources, increased flexibility, adaptability and evolvability. However, there are a number of associated challenges that need to be properly addressed before applying the cloud technique generally in industries. Providing efficient and predictable computation and communication is one of the important challenges, since many industrial systems (e.g. a control system) have specific timing requirements. Our current work thus focuses on guaranteeing the predictability of a cloud-based service. Virtualization, as one of the key technologies in Cloud Computing, is used to abstract details of resources away from end-services which simplifies the resource sharing. It thus improves the resource utilization and saves budget for end-users.

Multi objective consolidation of virtual machines for green computing in Cloud data centers,E.

Modeling Cross-Architecture Co-Tenancy Performance Interference,W. Kuang; L. E. Brown; Z. Wang,NA; NA; NA,"2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing",,2015,,,231,240,"Cloud computing has become a dominant computing paradigm to provide elastic, affordable computing resources to end users. Due to the increased computing power of modern machines powered by multi/many-core computing, data centers often co-locate multiple virtual machines (VMs) into one physical machine, resulting in co-tenancy, and resource sharing and competition. Applications or VMs co-locating in one physical machine can interfere with each other despite of the promise of performance isolation through virtualization. Modelling and predicting co-run interference therefore becomes critical for data center job scheduling and QoS (Quality of Service) assurance. Co-run interference can be categorized into two metrics, sensitivity and pressure, where the former denotes how an application's performance is affected by its co-run applications, and the latter measures how it impacts the performance of its co-run applications. This paper shows that sensitivity and pressure are both application-and architecture dependent. Further, we propose a regression model that predicts an application's sensitivity and pressure across architectures with high accuracy. This regression model enables a data center scheduler to guarantee the QoS of a VM/application when it is scheduled to co-locate with another VMs/applications.",,978-1-4799-8006,10.1109/CCGrid.2015.152,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152489,cloud computer;regression model;co-run interference,Sensitivity;Predictive models;Degradation;Quality of service;Benchmark testing;Hidden Markov models;Data models,cloud computing;computer centres;multiprocessing systems;parallel architectures;quality of experience;regression analysis;scheduling;virtual machines;virtualisation,cross-architecture cotenancy performance interference;cloud computing;dominant computing paradigm;multicore computing;data centers;multiple virtual machines;physical machine;performance isolation;virtualization;corun interference;data center job scheduling;QoS assurance;quality of service;corun applications;regression model;VM-application;many-core computing,,2,,30,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Luo,"Department of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China; Department of Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China; Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton",IEEE Transactions on Computers,,2014,63,5,1111,1123,Many Internet applications can benefit from an automatic scaling property where their resource usage can be scaled up and down automatically by the cloud service provider. We present a system that provides automatic scaling for Internet applications in the cloud environment. We encapsulate each application instance inside a virtual machine (VM) and use virtualization technology to provide fault isolation. We model it as the Class Constrained Bin Packing (CCBP) problem where each server is a bin and each class represents an application. The class constraint reflects the practical limit on the number of applications a server can run simultaneously. We develop an efficient semi-online color set algorithm that achieves good demand satisfaction ratio and saves energy by reducing the number of servers used when the load is low. Experiment results demonstrate that our system can improve the throughput by 180% over an open source implementation of Amazon EC2 and restore the normal QoS five times as fast during flash crowds. Large scale simulations demonstrate that our algorithm is extremely scalable: the decision time remains under 4 s for a system with 10 000 servers and 10 000 applications.

Joint Computation Offloading and Prioritized Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing,L. Gao; M.

These data usually require real-time, intensive computation. Yet, Meeting the required Quality of Service (QoS) remains a challenge due to the tension between resource-limited devices and computation-intensive applications. Mobile-edge computing (MEC) emerges as a promising technique to cope with the stringent requirements of mobile applications. This paper proposes a joint computation offloading and prioritized task scheduling scheme in a MEC system. We investigate an energy-minimizing task offloading strategy in mobile devices, and also develop an effective dynamic priority-based task scheduling algorithm at the edge server. The execution time, execution cost, and bonus score are adopted as performance metrics. We also defined a new performance metric, bonus score, which measures the benefit of finishing a task before its latency requirement deadline, and is a function of its completion time, priority level, and task size. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces both task completion time and edge server VM usage cost, and improves QoS in terms of bonus score. Moreover, dynamic prioritized task scheduling is also developed, with results showing that dynamic threshold setting further improves the performance.

We have addressed the problem of Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation in the data center servers using the technique of Bin Completion. Bin Completion is basically an artificial intelligence based algorithm used for bin packing problem. We have scaled up and modified the algorithm to fit our problem statement of VM consolidation and analysed the results obtained against Best Fit algorithm.

How much power and how many servers for the underlying physical infrastructure are saved via server consolidation in VM-based data centers is of great interest to administrators and designers of those data centers. Various workload consolidations differ in saving power and physical servers for the infrastructure. The impacts caused by virtualization to those concurrent services are fluctuating considerably which may have a great effect on server consolidation. This paper proposes a utility analytic model for Internet-oriented server consolidation in VM-based data centers, modelling the interaction between server arrival requests with several QoS requirements, and capability flowing amongst concurrent services, based on the queuing theory. According to features of those services' workloads, this model can provide the upper bound of consolidated physical servers needed to guarantee QoS with the same loss probability of requests as in dedicated servers. At the same time, it can also evaluate the server consolidation in terms of power and utility of physical servers. Finally, we verify the model via a case study comprised of one e-book database service and one e-commerce Web service, simulated respectively by TPC-W and SPECweb2005 benchmarks. Our experiments show that the model is simple but accurate enough. The VM-based server consolidation saves up to 50% physical infrastructure, up to 53% power, and improves 1.7 times in CPU resource utilization, without any degradation of concurrent services' performance, running on Rainbow - our virtual computing platform.",1552-5244;2168-9253,978-1-4244-5011-4978-1-4244-5012,10.1109/CLUSTR.2009.5289190,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5289190,utility analysis;server consolidation;model,Web server;Costs;Web and internet services;Queueing analysis;Upper bound;Databases;Web services;Resource management;Degradation;Concurrent computing,computer centres;software architecture;virtual machines;Web services,utility analysis;Internet-oriented server consolidation;virtualization technology;VM-based data centers;server consolidation;Internet-service-oriented enterprise data centers;utility analytic model;server arrival requests;QoS requirements;queuing theory;e-book database service;e-commerce Web service;SPECweb2005 benchmarks;TPC-W benchmarks;CPU resource utilization;virtual computing platform,,15,,43,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Inter-VM Interference in Cloud Environments: A Survey,S. Amri; H. Hamdi; Z. Brahmi,NA; NA; NA,2017 IEEE/ACS 14th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA),,2017,,,154,159,"Cloud Computing paradigm has been a trend in the computational world. Thus, many service providers today are competing to enhance their features and attract more customers as they are offering them a bunch of services through a pay-asyou-go pricing model. However, despite their huge fame, cloud environments still suffer from some issues that are being studied by researchers from various perspectives. One of the controversial cloud issues nowadays is interference among virtual machines (VMs) sharing the same hardware platform called also physical machine (PM). This problem occurs due to contention on shared resources between co-hosted VMs which results in performance degradation. Resource contention happens when demand for shared resources exceeds the supply due to VMs cohosting. The co-hosting of VMs on the same PM, emerges from the ambition of server consolidation that cloud providers aim to reach in order to improve power efficiency and optimize resource utilization. Therefore, the key factor of successful server consolidation is to minimize performance interference among colocated VMs. In this paper, we are going to reveal the interference issue as well as its major cause, survey existing researchers' visions to detect and/or predict such issue and exhibit a comparative study between them. Then we will reveal some challenging points that require further consideration.

Sharing of physical resources, however, comes usually at the cost of performance and poses significant challenges to respect the Quality-of-Service of consolidated data-intensive applications due to the mutual performance interference among the applications. The non-trivial impact of workload consolidation on the I/O performance can be anticipated using explicit performance analysis techniques. In current practice, however, explicit modeling of I/O performance interference effects in virtualized environments is usually avoided due to their complexity. In this paper, we present an explicit performance modeling approach of I/O performance interference in virtualized environments with queueing Petri nets (QPNs).

Then, we create a single-VM I/O performance model calibrated with response time measurements to capture the complex behavior of a representative, real-world environment based on IBM System z and IBM DS8700 server hardware. Finally, we use the I/O performance model to evaluate the I/O performance when the workload is distributed heterogeneously on colocated virtual machines.

In Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled clouds, this is possible by reconfiguring network flows dynamically adapting to network traffics. In this paper, we propose priority-aware resource placement algorithms considering both host and network resources. Our priority-aware VM allocation (PAVA) algorithm places VMs of the high-priority application to closely connected hosts to reduce the chance of network congestion caused by other tenants. The required bandwidth of a critical application is also guaranteed by bandwidth allocation with a configuration of priority queues on each networking device in a data center network managed by SDN controller.

However, a growing concern is the increasing amount of energy required to operate the data center. This has led to an industry-wide effort to look for ways the energy footprint of the datacenter can be reduced. Efficient scaling of the cloud's nodes is one way to manage the energy consumption. This goal is achieved through the application of energy optimization techniques. One of the techniques is to dynamically provision IT resources by switching the state of the cloud nodes from active to sleep and from sleep to active in response to the actual network load. To compensate for the potential impact of the time delay inherent in changing the state of a system, there is need to accurately predict the future load. The multi-tenant nature of cloud computing systems require that the load prediction takes into account that there can be multiple deployments of the same configured system over many different physical virtual and physical systems as well as that different services can be deployed in clusters across both virtual and physical systems. It is therefore important to predict the future network load per service-cluster.

In this paper, we determine that existing I/O schedulers working with SSDs fail to guarantee SLAs among virtualmachines, and do not effectively utilize the high performance of SSDs. To address this issue, we propose the opportunistic I/O scheduler (OIOS), a novel I/O scheduler for SSDs. OIOS guarantees SLAs and fully utilizes the high performance of SSDs. To support realistic SLAs, OIOS provides diverse SLA support functions, including reservations, limitations, and proportional sharing. In addition, OIOS accepts SLAs that are specified in four measurement types: bandwidth, I/Os per second (IOPS), latency, and utilization. Experimental results show that OIOS increases the aggregated bandwidth of VMs by 80 percent compared to mClock, while achieving a similar level of fairness.

As a result, such platforms are better equipped to execute workloads with diverse I/O requirements, ranging from throughput-intensive applications, such as `big data' analytics, to latency-sensitive applications, such as online applications with strict response-time guarantees. Improvements are also seen for the virtualization infrastructures used in data center settings, where high virtualized I/O performance supported by high-end fabrics enables more applications to be configured and deployed in multiple VMs - VM ensembles (VMEs) - distributed and communicating across multiple datacenter nodes. A challenge for I/O-intensive VM ensembles is the efficient management of the virtualized I/O and compute resources they share with other consolidated applications, particularly in lieu of VME-level SLA requirements like those pertaining to low or predictable end-to-end latencies for applications comprised of sets of interacting services. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a management solution able to consider such SLA requirements, by supporting diverse SLA-aware policies, such as those maintaining bounded SLA guarantees for all VMEs, or those that minimize the impact of misbehaving VMEs. The management solution, termed Distributed Resource Exchange (DRX), borrows techniques from principles of microeconomics, and uses online resource pricing methods to provide mechanisms for such distributed and coordinated resource management. DRX and its mechanisms allow policies to be deployed on such a cluster in order to provide SLA guarantees to some applications by charging all the interfering VMEs `equally' or based on the `hurt', i.e. amount of I/O performed by the VMEs. While these mechanisms are general, our implementation is specifically for SR-IOV-based fabrics like InfiniBand and the KVM hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation consists of workloads representative of data-analytics, transactional and parallel benchmarks. The results demonstrate the feasibility of DRX and its utility to maintain SLA for transactional applications.

This paper will present various native I/O virtualization technologies (SRIOV, MRIOV and other proprietary ones) and describe how they will address the challenges presented by Server Virtualization. These emerging Hardware based I/O technologies can help IT organizations further increase consolidation ratios, virtualize a wider range of applications, and manage workloads more effectively by providing near to direct I/O access Performance as the I/O path length is comparable to a dedicated adapter assigned to a VM. .

Analysis of a Self-Organizing Algorithm for Energy Saving in Data Centers,C. Mastroianni; M. Meo; G. Papuzzo,NA; NA; NA,"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel & Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum",,2013,,,907,914,"The Cloud computing paradigm allows users to satisfy their increasing need for on-demand and remote computational services. These services are provided by data centers that often consume a huge amount of electrical power. Recently the ecoCloud algorithm has been proposed as a solution for saving energy by consolidating Virtual Machines on as few servers as possible, so as to hibernate the remaining servers and save energy. The ecoCloud approach founds on probabilistic processes: mapping and migration of VMs are driven by Bernoulli trials whose success probability depends on the utilization of single servers. These processes are self-organizing and decentralized, which makes them particularly efficient in large data centers. While in previous work the performance evaluation of ecoCloud was based on artificial traces, in this paper, a mathematical analysis is presented along with simulations fed with logs of real VMs. Results show that efficiency is very close to the theoretical minimum and comparable to that of one of the best centralized algorithms devised so far; in addition, ecoCloud notably reduces the frequency of events, such as VM migrations and server switches, that can deteriorate the quality of service.",,978-0-7695-4979-8978-0-7695-4979,10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.184,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650972,,Servers;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Quality of service;Virtual machining;Probabilistic logic;Availability,cloud computing;computer centres;mathematical analysis;probability;virtual machines,mathematical analysis;success probability;Bernoulli trials;probabilistic processes;ecoCloud approach;virtual machines;ecoCloud algorithm;remote computational services;cloud computing paradigm;data centers;energy saving;self-organizing algorithm,,5,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Multi-VM applications usually have, in addition to their basic resource requirements, a special set of requirements that the data centre provider has to satisfy as well. We refer to these requirements as placement constraints. We propose two management strategies designed to manage multi-VM applications with placement constraints in data centres. These management strategies aim to increase data centre's resource utilization (and thus reduce power consumption) while at the same time minimizing SLA violations. One of the management strategies enforces placement constraints at all times, while the other allows for a temporary violation of placement constraints. The two management strategies are evaluated through simulation in multiple scenarios. Results suggest that both strategies are able to achieve high levels of infrastructure utilization and SLA achievement, while satisfying applications' placement constraints, and that temporarily violating constraints does not provide any advantage and it does add cost.",1573-0077,978-1-4799-8241,10.1109/INM.2015.7140308,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140308,,Stress;Servers;Security;Resource management;Power demand;Time factors,computer centres;contracts;resource allocation;virtual machines,dynamic application management;virtualized data centres;single-VM application management;multiVM application management;placement constraints;resource utilization;SLA violations;infrastructure utilization;SLA achievement;temporarily violating constraints,,1,,24,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Over past few years, many applications have been built using SDN such as server load balancing, virtual-machine migration, traffic engineering and access control. In this paper, we focus on using SDN for energy-aware routing (EAR). Since traffic load has a small influence on power consumption of routers, EAR allows to put unused links into sleep mode to save energy. SDN can collect traffic matrix and then computes routing solutions satisfying QoS while being minimal in energy consumption. However, prior works on EAR have assumed that the table of OpenFlow switch can hold an infinite number of rules. In practice, this assumption does not hold since the flow table is implemented with Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) which is expensive and power-hungry. In this paper, we propose an optimization method to minimize energy consumption for a backbone network while respecting capacity constraints on links and rule space constraints on routers. In details, we present an exact formulation using Integer Linear Program (ILP) and introduce efficient greedy heuristic algorithm. Based on simulations, we show that using this smart rule space allocation, it is possible to save almost as much power consumption as the classical EAR approach.",1930-529X,978-1-4799-3512,10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037187,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037187,,Routing;Ear;Switches;Heuristic algorithms;Ports (Computers);Power demand,integer programming;linear programming;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing,rule placement;software-defined networks;energy-aware routing;network programmability;EAR;traffic matrix;QoS;energy consumption;OpenFlow switch;ternary content addressable memory;TCAM;optimization method;integer linear program;ILP;greedy heuristic algorithm,,49,,24,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Two tough issues are addressed: (1) the profits of resource providers and customers often contradict mutually; (2) VM-maintenance overhead like startup cost is often too huge to be neglected. Not only can we derive an optimal price in the acceptable price range that satisfies both customers and providers simultaneously, but we also find a best-fit billing cycle to maximize social welfare (i.e., the sum of the cost reductions for all customers and the revenue gained by the provider). We carefully evaluate the proposed optimized fine-grained pricing scheme with two large-scale real-world production traces (one from Grid Workload Archive and the other from Google data center). We compare the new scheme to classic coarse-grained hourly pricing scheme in experiments and find that customers and providers can both benefit from our new approach.

Improving consolidation of virtual machines with risk-aware bandwidth oversubscription in compute clouds,D. Breitgand; A. Epstein,"Virtualization Technologies, System Technologies & Services, IBM Research - Haifa, Israel; Virtualization Technologies, System Technologies & Services, IBM Research - Haifa, Israel",2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM,,2012,,,2861,2865,"Current trends in virtualization, green computing, and cloud computing require ever increasing efficiency in consolidating virtual machines without degrading quality of service. In this work, we consider consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers (e.g., hosts or racks) in a cloud where the physical network (e.g., network interface or top of the rack switch link) may become a bottleneck. Since virtual machines do not simultaneously use maximum of their nominal bandwidth, the capacity of the physical container can be multiplexed. We assume that each virtual machine has a probabilistic guarantee on realizing its bandwidth Requirements-as derived from its Service Level Agreement with the cloud provider. Therefore, the problem of consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers, while preserving these bandwidth allocation guarantees, can be modeled as a Stochastic Bin Packing (SBP) problem, where each virtual machine's bandwidth demand is treated as a random variable. We consider both offline and online versions of SBP. Under the assumption that the virtual machines' bandwidth consumption obeys normal distribution, we show a 2-approximation algorithm for the offline version and improve the previously reported results by presenting a (2 +∈)-competitive algorithm for the online version. We also observe that a dual polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for SBP can be obtained via reduction to the two-dimensional vector bin packing problem.

With these rapid enhancements, the scale and complexity of systems providing cloud computing services have also increased tremendously. The major challenge faced by cloud service providers today is to provide an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable solution for seamless delivery of services to users. To achieve this research community is constantly working hard on different related issues like scheduling, power consumption, high availability, customer retention, resource provisioning, reliability and minimizing the probability of failures, etc. Reliability of service is an important parameter. With a large number of components in the cloud, the probability of failures is becoming a norm rather than an exception while delivering services to users. This emphasizes the need to develop fault tolerant schemes for cloud environment to deliver the required level of reliability. In this work, we have proposed a novel fault detection and mitigation approach. The novelty of approach lies in the method of detecting the fault based on running status of the job. The detection algorithm periodically monitors the progress of job on virtual machines (VMs) and reports the stalled job due to failed VM to fault tolerant manager (FTM).

Migration-Based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling in Cloud Data Center,Q. Huang; S. Su; S. Xu; J. Li; P. Xu; K.

However, it is still a challenging scheduling problem for cloud provider to dynamically manage the VM allocation for handling variable workloads without Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. In this paper, we propose a Migration-based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling (MECS) mechanism to automate elastic resource scaling for cloud systems. Different from the previous researches, we take both the dynamic workload fluctuation and the VM migration overhead into account. We first develop an online resource demand predictor, which is an ARIMA-based VM resource demand state predictor, to achieve adaptive resource allocation for cloud applications. We then propose a migration-based elastic consolidation scheduling heuristic to dynamically consolidate the VMs with adaptive resource allocation for reducing the number of physical machines.

Distributed Autonomous Virtual Resource Management in Datacenters Using Finite-Markov Decision Process,H. Shen; L. Chen,"Computer Science Department, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,,2017,25,6,3836,3849,"To provide robust infrastructure as a service, clouds currently perform load balancing by migrating virtual machines (VMs) from heavily loaded physical machines (PMs) to lightly loaded PMs. Previous reactive load balancing algorithms migrate VMs upon the occurrence of load imbalance, while previous proactive load balancing algorithms predict PM overload to conduct VM migration. However, both methods cannot maintain long-term load balance and produce high overhead and delay due to migration VM selection and destination PM selection. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose a proactive Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based load balancing algorithm. We handle the challenges of allying MDP in virtual resource management in cloud datacenters, which allows a PM to proactively find an optimal action to transit to a lightly loaded state that will maintain for a longer period of time. We also apply the MDP to determine destination PMs to achieve long-term PM load balance state. Our algorithm reduces the numbers of service level agreement (SLA) violations by long-term load balance maintenance, and also reduces the load balancing overhead (e.g., CPU time and energy) and delay by quickly identifying VMs and destination PMs to migrate. We further propose enhancement methods for higher performance. First, we propose a cloud profit oriented reward system in the MDP model so that when the MDP tries to maximize the rewards for load balance, it concurrently improves the actual profit of the datacenter. Second, we propose a new MDP model, which considers the actions for both migrating a VM out of a PM and migrating a VM into a PM, in order to reduce the overhead and improve the effectiveness of load balancing. Our trace-driven experiments show that our algorithm outperforms both previous reactive and proactive load balancing algorithms in terms of SLA violation, load balancing efficiency, and long-term load balance maintenance.

However, most existing works consider the inter-VM relations without taking the heterogeneity of cloud data centers into account. In practice, heterogeneous physical machines (PM) in a heterogeneous data center are often partitioned into logical groups for load balancing and specific services, cloud users always assigned their VMs with specific PM requirements, which make the inter-VM relations far more complex.

Unproductive tasks scheduling can lead to an increase in the operational cost of cloud provider side, which in turn increases the cloud services cost at cloud consumer side. One of the effective techniques to address these issues in cloud datacenters is the elasticity by allowing dynamic resource provisioning based on the current demand and varying workload running upon virtual machines (VMs) over time. This leads to an increase in the resource utilization, and reduced power consumption by turning off the idle physical machines. However, the dynamic resource provisioning due to the growing service demand and higher quality of service requirements of the users can cause a violation of service level agreement. In this paper, we propose a model based on linear regression to manage and reformulate cloud users requests and dynamically generating rules based on historical data of their requests in order to update association functions to address and adapt the changes of different types of workloads running on the cloud provider datacenter.

In addition, the probability of a node failure increases with the number of nodes. Apart from reducing the provider's computation power and jeopardizing the fulfillment of his contracts, this can also lead to computation time wasting when the crash occurs before finishing the task execution. In order to avoid this problem, efficient checkpoint infrastructures are required, especially in virtualized environments where these infrastructures must deal with huge virtual machine images. This paper proposes a smart checkpoint infrastructure for virtualized service providers. It uses Another Union File System to differentiate read-only from read-write parts in the virtual machine image. In this way, read-only parts can be checkpointed only once, while the rest of checkpoints must only save the modifications in read-write parts, thus reducing the time needed to make a checkpoint. The checkpoints are stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System. This allows resuming a task execution faster after a node crash and increasing the fault tolerance of the system, since checkpoints are distributed and replicated in all the nodes of the provider. This paper presents a running implementation of this infrastructure and its evaluation, demonstrating that it is an effective way to make faster checkpoints with low interference on task execution and efficient task recovery after a node failure.",2374-9709;1542-1201;1542-1201,978-1-4244-5366-5978-1-4244-5367,10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488493,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488493,,Fault tolerance;Computer crashes;Virtual machining;File systems;Contracts;Lead time reduction;Finishing;Interference;Quality of service;Image restoration,checkpointing;distributed databases;fault tolerant computing;task analysis;virtual machines,checkpoint based fault tolerant infrastructure;virtualized service provider;crash failure;omission failure;node failure;computation time wasting;computation power;checkpoint infrastructure;virtual machine image;union file system;read only part;read write part;Hadoop distributed file system;fault tolerance;task recovery;another union file system,,17,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In order to reduce the operational expenditure for maintaining the distributed cloudlets, each cloudlet is powered by green energy and uses on-grid power as a backup. Owing to the spatial dynamics of energy demands and green energy generations, the energy gap among different cloudlets in the network is unbalanced, i.e., some cloudlets&#x0027; energy demands can be fully provisioned by their green energy generations but others need to utilize on-grid power to meet their energy demands.

As time passed on, there was a tremendous increase in data getting generated which ultimately led to large processing. Moreover the systems and applications also got distributed to cope up with the increase in data processing with one reason being the downfall in the prices of the electronic devices. Today is the period of cloud which is felt as the successor of grid. Cloud computing is a model of computing where the IT resources need of the customers is satisfied. The true advantage of cloud usage is felt only when the services that are requested by the end users are made available without interrupt. This in turn requires a good network. So as the machines got virtualized to utilize the maximum processing power, the network was also thought to be made virtualized. This could lead to a new era of converging cloud computing and networking by means of Service Oriented Architecture which is basically integrating different kind of services. In this paper we present a survey of different systems that support network virtualization. Also we bring out the challenges in a detailed manner that is faced while making convergence of cloud and network services. We also propose a theoretical model that lays a foundation for future generation internet. This is an empirical model where the results are probabilistic which is mainly due to the unpredictable nature of the network. By means of network virtualization, the composite cloud-network service is presented to the end user and the user by making use of some heuristic search algorithm, can select the service which offers the desired QoS.",2377-6927,978-1-4799-8159-5978-1-4799-8466,10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229704,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229704,Cloud computing;SOA;virtualization;virtual networks;empirical model;linear regression,Quality of service;Kernel;Switches;Logic gates;Tagging;Virtual machine monitors;Clouds,cloud computing;search problems;service-oriented architecture;virtualisation,future generation Internet;network virtualization;data processing;electronic devices;cloud computing;customer IT resource need satisfaction;cloud usage;service oriented architecture;support network virtualization;composite cloud-network service;heuristic search algorithm,,,,40,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Virt Cache: Managing Virtual Disk Performance Variation in Distributed File Systems for the Cloud,R. V. Arumugam; Q. Xu; H. Shi; Q. Cai; Y. Wen,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,,2014,,,210,217,"As Applications are moved from physical servers to virtual machines sharing storage resources, they experience large variation in I/O latencies. While maintaining average performance in such virtualized environments is important to conform to service level agreements (SLA), cloud users also expect their applications to have minimum variation in tail end latencies like 90th percentile latency for predictable performance. This becomes a challenging problem as the deviation in the application's 90th percentile I/O latency from average latency under storage resource sharing (VM consolidation) can be very high. We show through experiments under VM consolidation that during peak loads this latency variation from average can be as much as 5 times compared to when the application has exclusive access to the storage devices. This variation in performance exists for both Hard drives (HDD) and Solid state drives (SSD). To minimize this large latency variation, we propose a dynamic I/O redirection and caching mechanism called Virt Cache. Virt Cache can pro-actively detect storage device contention at the storage server and temporarily redirect the peaking virtual disk workload to a dynamically instantiated distributed read-write cache. We have implemented our system in Gluster FS, a commonly used distributed file system deployed as a backing store in the cloud. Our system can achieve from 50% to 83% reduction in the 90th percentile latency deviation from average compared to previous work as we move from low load conditions to peak non uniform consolidated VM workloads. With our Virt Cache system, Cloud providers can guarantee predictable performance for the cloud users as if their application has exclusive access to the storage resources.",,978-1-4799-4093,10.1109/CloudCom.2014.166,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037669,Storage;Distributed file system;Service level objective;Distributed Cache;Virtualization,Servers;Load modeling;Performance evaluation;Interference;Time factors;Predictive models;Electronic mail,cache storage;cloud computing;distributed databases;input-output programs;resource allocation;virtual machines,VirtCache;virtual disk performance variation management;distributed file systems;physical servers;virtual machines;storage resources;IO latencies;virtualized environments;service level agreements;SLA;cloud users;storage resource sharing;VM consolidation;hard drives;HDD;solid state drives;SSD;latency variation;dynamic IO redirection;storage device contention;storage server;dynamically instantiated distributed read-write cache;peaking virtual disk workload,,3,,19,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
NoC Based Virtualized Accelerators for Cloud Computing,H. L. Kidane; E. Bourennane; G. Ochoa-Ruiz,NA; NA; NA,2016 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSOC),,2016,,,133,137,"Hardware accelerators (HwAcc) provide good performance in computation intensive applications. Integrating hardware accelerators in a cloud environment is the optimal way to improve the quality of service. However, mapping all possible application statically into the reconfigurable fabric of the FPGA is rather impractical and prohibitively expensive in terms of resource and power consumption. This problem can be alleviated via time multiplexing the access to the underlying hardware resources by designing dynamically reconfigurable accelerators in the cloud. Two cloud service: Reconfigurable IPs as a Service (RIPaaS) and Reconfigurable Region as a Service (RRaaS) are considered in this paper. Similarly, the connection and communication between the accelerators and the reconfigurable control will not be efficient without the use of Network-on-Chip (NoC). In order to address these issues, we propose a NoC based virtualized accelerators for cloud computing. Reconfigurable accelerators communicate their status and exchange data through the routers connected to them. A Hypervisor is used as an intermediate level between the physical reconfigurable hardware and application layer to manage the FPGA resources. A 2×2-mesh NoC based reconfigurable accelerators for image analysis and matrix computation are implemented and tested showing a promising result for more scalable systems in cloud computing.",,978-1-5090-3531-1978-1-5090-3532,10.1109/MCSoC.2016.21,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774430,FPGA;Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration;Hardware accelerators;Network-on-Chip;Cloud Computing,Field programmable gate arrays;Cloud computing;Hardware;Virtual machine monitors;Hardware design languages;Routing protocols;Computer architecture,cloud computing;field programmable gate arrays;network-on-chip;virtualisation,NoC based virtualized accelerators;network-on-chip;cloud computing;hardware accelerators;HwAcc;cloud environment;quality of service;RIPaaS;reconfigurable IPs as a service;RRaaS;reconfigurable region as a service;FPGA resources;field programmable gate array,,1,,18,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Cost aware fault recovery in clouds,A. Israel; D. Raz,"Technion Institute of Technology, Israel; Technion Institute of Technology, Israel",2013 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2013),,2013,,,9,17,"Maintaining high availability of IaaS services at a reasonable cost is a challenging task that received recent attention due to the growing popularity of Cloud computing as a preferred means of affordable IT outsourcing. In large data-centers faults are prone to happen and thus the only reasonable cost-effective method of providing high availability of services is an SLA aware recovery plan; that is, a mapping of the service VMs onto backup machines where they can be executed in case of a failure. The recovery process may benefit from powering on some of these machines in advance, since redeployment on powered machines is much faster. However, this comes with an additional maintenance cost, so the real problem is how to balance between the expected recovery time improvement and the cost of machines activation. We model this problem as an offline optimization problem and present a bicriteria approximation algorithm for it. While this is the first performance guaranteed algorithm for this problem, it is somewhat complex to implement in practice. Thus, we further present a much simpler and practical heuristic based on a greedy approach. We evaluate the performance of this heuristic over real data-center data, and show that it performs well in terms of scale, hierarchical faults and variant costs. Our results indicate that our scheme can reduce the overall recovery costs by 10-15% when compared to currently used approaches. We also show that fault recovery cost aware VM placement may farther help reducing the expected recovery costs, as it can reduce the backup machine activations costs.",1573-0077,978-3-901882-50-0978-1-4673-5229,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6572964,,Availability;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms;Maintenance engineering;Hardware;Linear systems;Optimization,approximation theory;cloud computing;cost reduction;greedy algorithms;optimisation;performance evaluation;virtual machines,backup machine activation cost reduction;fault recovery cost aware VM placement;recovery cost reduction;hierarchical faults;real data center data;performance evaluation;performance guaranteed algorithm;bicriteria approximation algorithm;offline optimization problem;recovery time improvement;maintenance cost;powered machines;backup machines;SLA aware recovery plan;cost-effective method;data center faults;IT outsourcing;cloud computing;IaaS services;cost aware fault recovery,,,,24,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Implications of cache asymmetry on server consolidation performance,P. Apparao; R. Iyer; D. Newell,"Hardware Architecture Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA; Hardware Architecture Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA; Hardware Architecture Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA",2008 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization,,2008,,,24,32,"Todaypsilas CMP platforms are designed to be symmetric in terms of platform resources such as shared caches. However, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the performance implications of asymmetric caches for two key reasons: (a) multi-workload scenarios such as server consolidation are a growing trend and contention for shared cache resources between workloads causes logical cache asymmetry, (b) future CMP platforms may be designed to be physically asymmetric in hardware due to die area pressure, process variability or power/performance efficiency. Our focus in this paper is to understand the performance implications of both logical as well as physical asymmetric caches on server consolidation. Based on real measurements of a state-of-the-art CMP processor running a server consolidation benchmark (vConsolidate) we compare the performance implications as a function of (a) symmetric caches, (b) virtually asymmetric caches, (c) physically asymmetric caches and (d) a combination of logically and physically asymmetric caches. We analyze the performance behavior in terms of (i) performance of each of the individual workloads being consolidated and (ii) architectural components such as CPI and MPI. We believe that this asymmetric cache study is the first of its kind and provides useful data/insights on cache characteristics of server consolidation.

The proposed formulation presents an accurate carbon footprint evaluation based on joint optimization techniques, such as smart and performance-aware workload consolidation, along with cooling efficiency maximization, while considering the greenness factor of the data centers and the dynamic behavior of the equipment cooling fans. Simulations with an exact method showed that, compared with other baseline approaches, the proposed mathematical model leads to optimal configurations with minimal GhG emissions in a single cloud, as well as in an InterCloud environment, and can yield savings of up to 65 percent.

Flexible SLAs in the Cloud with a Partial Utility-Driven Scheduling Architecture,J. Simão; L. Veiga,NA; NA,2013 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,,2013,1,,274,281,"Current clouds SLAs include compensation for customers (i.e. resource renters) with credits when average availability drops below a certain point. However, this credit scheme is too inflexible because consumers lose a non measurable quantity of performance and are only compensated later (i.e. in the next charging cycle). We propose to schedule cloud isolation and execution units, i.e. virtual machines (VMs), driven by the partial utility of applying a certain amount of resources (CPU, memory or bandwidth) to a given VM. This partial utility metric, specified by the customer, allows the provider to transfer resources between VMs. This is particularly relevant for private clouds where resources are not so abundant. We have defined a cost model that incorporates the partial utility the client gives to a certain level of depreciation when VMs are allocated in an over commit environment. CloudSim, a state of the art cloud simulator, was extended to support our partial utility-driven scheduling model. Using simulation scenarios with synthetic and real workloads, we show that our proposed scheduling strategy brings benefits to providers (i.e. revenue, resource utilization) and clients (i.e. workloads' execution time) by incorporating a SLA-based depreciation of computational power, allowing for more VMs to be allocated.",,978-0-7695-5095,10.1109/CloudCom.2013.43,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753808,Cloud Computing;Community Clouds;Service Level Agreements;Utility-driven Scheduling,Cloud computing;Resource management;Scheduling;Virtual machining;Computational modeling;Processor scheduling;Degradation,cloud computing;contracts;digital simulation;scheduling;virtual machines,flexible SLAs;cloud SLAs;partial utility-driven scheduling architecture model;credit scheme;cloud isolation-execution unit scheduling;virtual machines;private clouds;cost model;CloudSim;cloud simulator;SLA-based depreciation;service level agreements;VM,,10,,28,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Acquisition of Virtual Machines for Tiered Applications with Availability Constraints,P. Sakhamuri; O. Das,NA; NA,2017 IEEE 18th International Symposium on High Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE),,2017,,,132,135,"Deploying and managing a high availability tiered application in the cloud is a challenging task because it requires determining and buying enough number of VMs dynamically such that the application is available. An application is available if it is working and it can respond in a timely manner for varying workloads. For a given workload, we will need a minimum number of working copies for each server and the minimum computing power of VMs necessary to run those copies for meeting the response time requirement. Otherwise, we will end up with response time failures. In this work, we assume that each software server of an application is replicated into one or more copies and each copy runs on a separate virtual machine (VM). VMs can be of different types depending on their computing power, availability and cost. This paper presents a novel optimization model to determine the number and types of VMs needed for each server that minimizes the cost and at the same time guarantees the availability SLA (service-level agreement). The results demonstrate that it is more cost effective to have a mixture of different types of VMs for running the copies of a server rather than restricting the copies to run on a single type of VMs. The results further demonstrate that the decision to buy only the cheapest VMs for an application is not always better cost-wise.",1530-2059,978-1-5090-4636-2978-1-5090-4637,10.1109/HASE.2017.16,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911885,Cloud computing;Application Service Provider;Steady-state availability;Optimization model,Optimization;Resource management;Web servers;Cloud computing;Time factors,,,,,,13,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

But running these systems on bare metal servers results in low resource utilization, because database servers often have to be sized for peak loads, much higher than the average load. Instead, we propose to deploy them within light-weight containers that allow to control resource usage and to make use of spare resources by temporarily running other applications on the database server using virtual machines (VMs). The servers on which these VMs would normally run can be suspended, to save energy costs. But current database systems do not handle dynamic changes to resource allocation well and accurate estimates on resource demand are required to maintain SLAs. We focus on emerging main-memory database systems that support the mixed workloads of today's business intelligence applications and propose an cooperative approach in which the DBMS communicates its resource demand, gets informed about currently assigned resources and adapts its resource usage accordingly.
